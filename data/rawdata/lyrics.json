We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight.  Please welcome Kanye West!\n\n[Kanye enters]\n\nJK:  How are you?\n\nKanye West:  I'm okay.\n\nJK:  I'm very happy that you came.  I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up.  I really felt bad about all this stuff.  I did.\n\nKW:  Mm-hmm. [Laughter]\n\nJK:  I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?\n\nKW: It's Ralph.\n\nJK: Kramden? Lauren?\n\nJK: Is that a new grill you have there?\n\nKW: Nah they've been in my mouth for three years.\n\nJK: That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you.\n\nKW: Good seeing you too.\n\nJK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you’re coming from is that true?\n\nKW: Yeah, correct.\n\nJK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview  with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I’ll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the [Zane Lowe] interview when we did this sketch.\n\nKW: Yeah, that’s what I thought.\n\nJK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn’t think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?\n\nLittle Kanye: I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?!\n\nJK: I'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse. I think it’s funny. (*Kanye laughs*) And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that’s not true. In fact, we’ve done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them. Of course this is not something you knew. And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. And you called me. A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up. But this isn't, right?\n\nKW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don’t do publicity stunts, period. So don’t ever think that.\n\nJK: Me neither guys. (Laughter) So we talked on the phone, and I didn’t really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?\n\nKW: Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way through because I didn't want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men… that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute.\n\nJK: And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didn't wanna go back to high school.\n\nJK: And this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about. This zoo animal, it's a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and I think people look at you and they go, \"this is a guy who’s got millions of dollars, he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can’t possibly hurt this guy.\" And to be honest, even though I’m in that same position too - I don't have a baby - it’s not something that comes to my mind when I’m cooking up a comedy sketch. And some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. And it's... but on the other hand, I will say a lot of times you I think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you.\n\nI personally found it odd to be in the position that I was in because I often… I don’t know if you know this, a lot of people think you’re a jerk. And I often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, I know this guy, he is not a jerk. In fact I think we have a picture which I happened to see on my Dad's iPad at the wedding and it's you and my Dad [*shows a photo of Kanye with Kimmel's dad] - who you may have though was Wolf Blitzer in fairness - but I mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a Southwest Airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. Everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know I have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior. But what I observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and I’ve always said that to people about you. And I think that's important for... I know part of you doesn’t care, I see you onstage saying, \"I don’t want to hold your baby, I’ll drop your baby on it’s head…\" you know I don’t believe any of that stuff when you say it.\n\nKW: I’m not running for office, I’m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that [Zane Lowe] interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of “just a celebrity.” Because you know for me, I’m a creative genius and there’s no other way to word it. I know you’re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples’ lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that’s what I was talking about on the Zane interview.\n\nSo when I come on here, I can laugh and I can joke, and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it’s bigger than who I am and my presence, living. It’s about when I was on Earth what did I do to help? And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this box. But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. Once you learn how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors. I have an art background even before I was a musician. People told me I couldn’t rap. People had all this advice for me about how I shouldn't try to rap. And I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.\n\nSo even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I said. Whereas if you look at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. Because most people just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras. Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. And ya know that's the reason why I went so crazy.\n\nJK: I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you’re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they’re geniuses, and nobody says it because it’s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say \"I am a genius\"…\n\nKW: I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.\n\nJK: That's true, it’s false humility.\n\nKW: Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here’s your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. But it's like that's not what we're doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame,  because they said something like they’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star. It's like people are so so dated and not modern. There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth. It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed. So you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.\n\n[Applause]\n\nJK: Alright, Kanye West is here, more with Kanye when we come back.\n\nAnnouncer: The best tweets of Kanye West.\n\nJosh Groban: Can we please toast to the motherfuckin' douchebags tonight? Do you know where to find marble conference tables? Looking to have a conference... not until I get the table though.\n\nAt most his tweets are 140 characters, but the depth of his passion is immeasurable.\n\nFur pillows are hard to actually sleep on. Man... what ever happened to my antique fish tank?\n\nAnnouncer: You'll get all of your favorites\n\nJosh Groban: Classical music is tight yo. I make awesome decisions in bike stores. French fries are the devil. Black is the new black.\n\nAnnouncer: And many many more. Josh Groban's the best tweets of Kanye West includes 752 original songs on 48 CDs.\n\nJosh Groban: I love me!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAnnouncer: In stores now.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-jimmy-kimmel-interview-part-1-annotated"},{"title":"2013 Jimmy Kimmel Interview (Part 2)","album":"Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness","artist":"Genius","number":"2013 Jimmy Kimmel Interview (Part 2)","lyrics":"[Kimmel]So now, that was funny, right?[Kanye]I imagine the skit was probably funny too.[Kimmel]It wasn’t that funny, to be honest with you. It was a five, I’d give it. So I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob?[Kanye]It’s the first thing that came to my mind.[Kimmel]Where were you when you were writing those tweets. I like to imagine, on the toilet.[Kanye]Yeah, that’s when I think of the best shit.I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA. As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life. You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say anything anymore. But just to completely wild out…The only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth.[Kimmel]It was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight.[Kanye]I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I do everything I can to break media.[Kimmel]From my standpoint, sometimes I’ll think of things and maybe it’s two o’clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, “Don’t tweet that. Do not tweet that.” Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don’t care.[Kanye]You shoulda saw the second set of tweets…[Kimmel]Save them for next time.I do just want to say congratulations on your new baby. In fact, I brought you a little gift. I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there’s some tiny little leather jogging pants[Kanye]Fashion isn’t always practical. It’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag. It’s more about, you know, pussy. It’s more about, like, club. It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision. We sat as interns at Fendi like six years ago. We had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the reason I brought that up in the Zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. It became  a phenomenon over the past three years. And it was to say, you know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these  big brands your ideas and everything.” And it would just be like, what I was trying to express in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could put the proper production around them. So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together. But if I go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?” But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like really genius.” You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. And that’s what I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the boat.[Kimmel]What about a Steve Harvey collection?[Kanye]Yeah, no. There’s no Steve Harvey collection. No extra buttons on jackets or anything like that.But for Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson had to fight to get his videos on MTV because he was considered to be “urban.” This is Michael Jackson.[Kimmel]That’s true. He was considered a Black artist and was not right for MTV at that time.[Kanye]Yeah, a black artist. So, for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names. Like stuff you can’t even say on TV. And I still can’t break that wall down. At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who’s known more for clothes than me? To not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, Leanne [?].  These are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. Zara, out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone. And everyone just sort of looks at you  like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet. And you’re just like, “How can you get a shot?” And then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels  I wanted to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. He just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.  So if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was old-school with it. They’re like, “We don’t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen. We’re classist now.” So this classism is what they do to try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality show. You’re not up here with us. You know, we’re old money, we--[Kimmel]It’s snobbery--[Kanye]It’s snobbery. And I’m not into all that snobbery. Because, you know what? We have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. All we want is a real shot.  Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. No, I understand about quality. I understand about fabrics. I spent ten thousand hours at this. I’ve dedicated my life to this. And a lot of people say, “OK, you have to do music.” I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened? What if people told me I couldn’t perform. I’m only 36 years old; I have other goals and other things.  And I’m gonna use my platform,  every platform, to stand up and say, “I want to make something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.” That was the point of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. [Turns to Kimmel]And the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m the one creative, and this is the reason why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s moments when I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing. Come and kill me. Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to bully me, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.” No matter how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself! Stop seeing what you can do! Stop affirming what you’re gonna do and then completing that in real life.” That’s the improper way to do it. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people  with low self-esteem. With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. The time you spend with your family, that’s the only luxury. So this concept of “luxury” is improper to me. You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.” I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. This is what I’m here to do, so  when I compare myself to Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, David Stern, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Jesus of whatever it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes. These are people I look up to. This is the type of impact I want to make on the earth.” If I can make this type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a shot.” If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid. This kid, his parents were educators. He wants to educate. He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I did in music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply to education. This is what my company Donda is about. I could rap all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain. I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it to the point to make “Jesus Walks.” And now, even as a celebrity,  I’ve reached a ceiling. And the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. We bring something of joy to the world. When people hear my music they have a good time. And I should be respected as such when I walk down the street. Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. Don’t try to antagonize me. Cause, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo. Never think that I’m not from Chicago for one second. And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, but let’s have respect for each other. You do help me get money, paparazzi,  you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people.[Kimmel]But when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there’s no human decency there.[Kanye]It’s a lack of decency.[Kimmel]Kanye West, everybody.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-jimmy-kimmel-interview-part-2-annotated"},{"title":"2013 Yeezus Tour Dates","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"October 19 2013       Seattle, WA              Key Arena*#October 20 2013       Vancouver, B.C.       Pepsi Live at Rogers Arena*#October 22 2013       San Jose, CA           SAP Center*#October 23 2013       Oakland, CA            Oracle Arena*#October 25 2013       Las Vegas, NV         MGM Grand Garden Arena*^October 26 2013       Los Angeles, CA     Staples Center*#October 28 2013            Los Angeles                  Staples CenterNovember 01 2013    Salt Lake City, UT   Energy Solutions Arena*#November 03 2013    Denver, CO             Pepsi Center*#November 05 2013    Minneapolis, MN     Target Center*#November 07 2013    Chicago, IL             United Center*#November 10 2013    Detroit, MI              Palace of Auburn Hills*#November 12 2013    Toronto, ONT.        Air Canada Centre*#November 14 2013    Montreal, QUE.       Bell Centre#November 16 2013    Philadelphia, PA    Wells Fargo Center*#November 17 2013    Boston, MA            TD Garden*#November 19 2013    Brooklyn, NY          Barclays Center*^November 21 2013    Washington, DC     Verizon Center#November 23 2013    New York, NY         Madison Square Garden*^November 29 2013    Miami, FL               American Airlines Arena*#November 30 2013    Tampa, FL             Tampa Bay Times Forum^December 01 2013    Atlanta, GA            Philips Arena#December 06 2013    Dallas, TX             American Airlines Center#December 07 2013    Houston, TX          Toyota Center## WITH KENDRICK LAMAR^ SPECIAL GUEST TO BE ANNOUNCEDTICKETS WITH* ON SALE FRIDAY 9 13 13","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-yeezus-tour-dates-annotated"},{},{"title":"24","album":"DONDA: WITH CHILD","artist":"Kanye West","number":"24","lyrics":"Lyrics from Snippet[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]Dear God, make it alright, only you can make it alrightDear Lord, make it alright, nothing else ever feels rightDear God, make it alright, nothing else ever feels rightNa, na, na, nothing else ever feels rightSave me, yeah, make it alrightBow heads 'cause it's alright, alright, mmTwenty-four hours, twenty-four candles, twenty-four hoursDear God, make it alright, only you can make it alrightDear Lord, make it alright, nothing else ever feels rightDear God, make it alright, nothing elsе ever feels rightNa, na, na, nothing elsе ever feels rightSave me, yeah, make it alrightBow heads 'cause it's alright, alright, mmTwenty-four hours, twenty-four candles, twenty-four hoursAh, yeah, yeahYeah-yeah, yeahThrow our hands in the skyYes Lord, we put 'em high[Bridge: Jason White & Sunday Service Choir]Father we go through thingsBut in the mindst of you said that you would never leave usSaid that you would never forsake us in this time of uncertaintyWe've lost someone's, some of our friends, and family have fallen shortBut you said that you would never leave usNor forsake us that you would be with usUntil the ends of the EarthCome on said\" Save meSave me","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-24-lyrics"},{"title":"2015 BET Honors Visionary Award Acceptance Speech","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled.

If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the moneyAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.\"So, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy ideaHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being coolI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2015-bet-honors-visionary-award-acceptance-speech-lyrics"},{"title":"30 Hours","album":"The Life of Pablo (2016)","artist":"View Tracklist MIKE DEANKanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestUltralight BeamFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1Pt. 2FamousFeedbackLow LightsHighlightsFreestyle 4I Love KanyeWavesFMLReal FriendsWolvesFrank’s TrackSiiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer IntermissionNo More Parties in LAFacts (Charlie Heat Version)FadeSaint PabloThe Life of Pablo Studio NotepadArthur RussellMalik YusefIsaac HayesJason “Jay E” EppersonNellyCharlie RussellMIKE DEANKarriem RigginsKanye WestPharrell WilliamsDrakeDomino Recording CompanyEMI Pop Music PublishingEMI Blackwood MusicSONGS Music PublishingROBA Music PublishingMissing Link MusicDiscoton MusicRondor MusicWarner Music GroupNew World MusicDomino Double Six PublishingMore Water From NazarethTuneCoreThe Bicycle Music CompanyBMGCanadiana MusicWarner-Tamerlane Publishing Corp.Swing T PublishingPlease Gimme My PublishingPapa George MusicNouveau MusicIrving MusicIncense ProductionsEMI Music Publishing GroupAscent MusicUniversal Music GroupKarriem Riggins MusicJay E’s BasementJackie Frost MusicJabriel Iz MyneD2 Pro PublishingAnother AudikaASCAPBMIAndré 3000Andrew DawsonNoah GoldsteinAnthony KilhofferMIKE DEANAndrew DawsonNoah GoldsteinMIKE DEAN30 Hours (Reference)Answers MeJoyThe Life of Peder, Pt. 1The Time BombGray’s Lament 7.6Delet30 Hours (Episode 4)JESUS WALKS.mp330 Hours (Reference)Paper Thin Love (30 Hours Demo)Hot in HerreE.I.Lost BoyParappa30 Hours for Pablo Dylan$30#stillPraying4 @kanyewest30 Hours (Freestyle)30 Hours (Remix)30 Dollars (Kanye West Remix)","number":"16","lyrics":"[Intro: Arthur Russell]\nBaby lion goes\nWhere the islands go\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYou say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone\nMillion dollar renovations to a happy home\nMy ex says she gave me the best years of her life\nI saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right\nI wake up, assessin' the damages\nCheckin' MediaTakeOut\nPictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch\nBut it's blurry enough to get the fake out\nI wake up, all veggies no eggs\nI hit the gym, all chest no legs\nYep, then I made myself a smoothie\nYeah, then me and wifey make a movie\nChicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nÁndale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh\nYou had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone\nYou was the best of all time at the time though\nYeah, you wasn't mine though\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nBut I still drove 30 hours\nAnd I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI remember rappin' for Jay and Cam\nYoung producer just trying to get his flows off\nI remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret\n'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off\nExpedition was Eddie Bauer edition\nI'm drivin' with no winter tires in December\nSkrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women\nThen I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl\nYou don't love me, you just pretendin'\nI need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'\nChicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nIt's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know\nGot a hotel room, three stars for you\nYou call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning\nYou realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria\nOnly thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me\nI used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'\n'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs\nBut you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time\nWell, I guess a blowjob's better than no job\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nAnd I drove back 30 hours\n\n[Bridge: Arthur Russell]\nWhere the main ties onto the sail\nBetter on sighting\nFor astern, oh\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]\n3 Stacks, can you help me out?\n30 hours\nYeah, this type of shit you just ride out to\n30 hours\n30 hours\nI just be like, it was my idea to have an open relationship\nNow a nigga mad\nNow I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill...\n30 hours\nJust to kill..\nJust to...\nJust to...\nI'm about to drive 90\n90 miles like Matt Barnes just to whoop a nigga ass\nIt was my idea and now a nigga (30 hours)\nNow a nigga mad, now a nigga, uh\nA stunna\nWhoop him after school just to show I got class\nDuh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh\nDuh-duh with you, yeah (30 hours)\nYou know what I'm sayin'?

It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, \"What's spurred that, to do it that way?\"[Kanye]I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go-- so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?[Michelle]I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say \"politics?\"[Kanye]I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?[Michelle]It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap.[Kanye]No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money.[Michelle]But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...[Kanye]No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, \"well-off\" is that, that is-- what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.[Michelle]That's fair enough, I get that.[Kanye]And then you're not well-off.[Michelle]That's-- yeah-- I'm sorry, I know it's not all about money, but I've just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and-- I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you.[Kanye]I'll-- now we are. Because of what we're doing. Because of the way we're turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But it's really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, it's hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the-- [?] who do the real work. Yeah, you get the Rihannas, the Big Seans, the Kanyes, but you need the Barry Weiss, the Steve Barlows and [?], and like these people, you know, all the people all the people who get mentioned on the Grammy speeches, and you just can't, that's-- what you're saying is like-- Okay, you're a major recording artist because you signed to a major label. Can't you just do independent clothing? The answer is, \"No.\" Now, can't you just get a clothing deal from a major label? The answer is, also, currently is, \"No.\" And that's the issue. That's the Truman Show wall. That's the glass ceilings. That's the Michael Jackson can't get his video played. Because everybody-- nobody is looking at what Obama is wearing. I'm the number one most influential person on the globe in fashion. [?] is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And that's the only way it's going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isn't where should be. Yeah I'm doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. That's the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I don't look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasn't gangsta enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting married to Kim Kardashian, and I've never played in the NBA.(Laughter)[MichelleOh my god.[Kanye]So, that's thought.[Michelle]You know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, I'm Michelle and we're live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I don't-- you definitely don't do things like everybody else. Do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, I'm not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean.[Kanye West]There's a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, there's an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that I'm saying because they'll lose their job.There is a a lack in creativity in Hollywood. There's a lack in creativity in clothing. There's a lack creativity in the education system. There's a lack in creativity on the globe period! @hen you look up and look at billboard ads, the majority of them suck. There's a lack creativity in advertising, in agencies. There's just a lack, because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for 20 years before their positioned to say the idea, and they might not have the relevancy anymore. Right now, I have the relevancy and I have the perspective and I have the voice and I'm going to scream as loud as I can. And ain't nothing gon' happen to me except success.[Michelle]You're here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that.There's so much passion because I share a lot of the same-- where the view is my passion, and I feel like people don't always get it. You know, and they're like, \"Gosh, it's kind of harsh\" with everyone. You've just got to be true to yourself. You know? I got to-- by the way, before I forget, you know with your clothing and your fashion, we were just talking about your merch line.[Kanye]Really quick, and don't forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term \"fashion,\" because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, it's been illegal to be naked. I'm helping people follow the law in style. I'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isn't about fashion. I'm creating new standards, things so you don't have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that I'm wearing. And I'll do all the hard work. I'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and-- and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. I'll do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, \"That looked crazy!\"There are certain things that are just standard. A suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket. A hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie. Jeans are jeans are jeans. And a Michael Jordan sneaker is a Michael Jordan sneaker. Now, let's take our kids to the park. It's not about fashion. It's about life, and me helping it become more awesome...(TO BE CONTINUED)","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-a-971-interview-part-2-8-28-13-annotated"},{"title":"Addiction","album":"Late Registration","artist":"Kanye West","number":"11","lyrics":"[Produced by Jon Brion & Kanye West][Intro: Etta James]You make me smile with my heart, ohh[Chorus: Kanye West, Etta James]Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?Everything they told me not to is exactly what I wouldMan, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I couldBut you make me smile[Verse 1: Kanye West, Etta James]What's your addiction?

a deal I'll get her a wedding ringBut when I got my deal I was back in the ringFighting my urges, strip club splurgesNever had money so I felt like a virginAnd I'm trying to break the bank's cherryTryin' to see can I afford CanariesWith a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle BerryWent from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a weekNow I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven ringsEight rings, er mother picked up the phoneLike, \"She in school and she don't stay here no more\"I guess there's more good women than men percentage wiseSo her chance of having a husband just minimizedI guess that's why she says she ain't into guysAnd focus on school full-time to improvise[Chorus]We ball 'til we fall, hit the mallAfter we hit, don't callWe fill your lives with nothing but liesAnd I would like to apologizeNo no, you can't stand right hereAnd tell me everything is gonna be alright'Cause until that real man stands upI'm going to have to

You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.distraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.everything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.trend is always lateApril 18th, 2018when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".  Parents are our first acting coaches.me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.don't trade your authenticity for approvaltruth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truthif you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.April 19th, 2018today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better.we're all servantsit's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them tothe beauty is in the imperfection(s)April 20th, 2018we need to Aman Giri the worldpeople are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hypeall you have to be is yourselfI don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.images are limitless and words aren't.

That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think.get past the pastThe more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolveApril 22ndquestion everythingthe blinders are offDemonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonizedwe have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck thereWe live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.self victimization is a diseaseApril 23we're evolving at warp speednew ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.life is more exciting than the movieseven Prince once had an access passeveryone should be their own biggest fanI’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to doIf your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your visionyou can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.April 24dragon 🐉 energyNatural born leadersVery instinctiveGreat foresightto be great is to be misunderstoodnever a master. Always a student.2024spread loveApril 25Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support HillaryI love Hillary too.I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republicanAnd also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say \"I love you\" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of lovefear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughtsdecentralizeburn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂whenever someone mentions the word \"fan\" to me it's super manipulative. It's like \"don't do or say this because of your fans\"  My fans are fans of themselves.And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️April 26th, 2018Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.The world is our familyPeople usually don't agree with people who don't agree with themif you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate youthe concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you.

life that you know about, you only gotAnd time is somethin' you can never get backMost important thingDon't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get backSo don't forgot that cause the money could goAnd you could spend it over and overAnd over and over, over, over, ohAnd the cars could crashAnd now did that tell me, \"What do you have?\"And the house can burn downAnd whose your real

Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys. But as we learn all the politics, and niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great, because he couldn't be him, to be who he was.Black men have been slaves, Obama wasn't allowed to do this, *screech*, and still win. He had to be perfect, but being perfect don't always change shit bro. Being perfect don't always change shit bro.So when I'm talking about MTV -- Let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyonce, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called \"Famous\", and out of respect, MTV told me \"Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyonce is winning the video tonight, for formation, over Hotline Bling and Famous.\" They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Ay bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision, and you know I'mma keep it real with you.Beyonce, I was hurt, I went down 7 years on behalf of yo --Ay nigga, don't throw no shit when I'm talkin'!I am putting my career, my life, my public well standing, at risk when I talk to y'all like this.

I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da VinciMore clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with (Lady) GagaI moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunityI designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite CollateI remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th gradeBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideasI appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor thatHmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughtsWhat good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…createI have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!The name of the company is DONDADONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachersDONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDAThis will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me wokeThe Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…I’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience…This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)We would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach outWe can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left offWhen I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real lifeSpike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!UNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?Allow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironicSome kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?Excuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things betterWhen me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support usThe adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 yearsI invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…There are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governmentsI just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-donda-2012-annotated"},{"title":"Don’t Give Up","album":"Unreleased Songs","artist":"View Tracklist Swizz BeatzKanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestNo More Parties in LA (Demo)DJ Khaled’s SonPop Style (Demo)God’s TestGo2DaMoon (Original)*New Slaves (Demo)Liberated (Father Stretch My Hands Demo)Follow God (Dr. Dre Remix)Cuban LinkFall Out of Heaven (Demo)The StormTrack 6 (Demo)Black Skinhead (Demo)Rap TarantinoI Am Not HomeLovely (Ant Clemons Reference)LovelyIn Abundance (Demo)ChakrasMama’s BoyfriendFace Down (G.O.O.D.

Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. WestDr. Kanye West: I’m sorry, that was just my opinionI am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas“I’m sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits. I didn’t know he was an artistI felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is “I need to get rid of that feeling.” I need to not be nervousThis honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don’t have to defend me as much, and I’m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it’s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I’ve been saying my entire life. Whether it’s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, “It’s okay, he doesn’t bite white people,” or the New York Times cover, or the Time “Most Influential” cover, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of ChicagoWhen I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school because when I went on that mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier if I could have said: \"I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago.\"Thank you","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-dr-kanye-west-honorary-doctorate-speech-lyrics"},{"title":"Drop Dead Gorgeous (Revised)","album":"Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 3 (2007)","artist":"View Tracklist Murphy LeeView All Credits Kanye WestJesus Walks (Remix)Hold On (Remix)Fly AwayWhere You At?

It’s like the pursuit of happiness, like it’s like, you’re trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period.Fuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone’s thinking. Start there... put some dope shit with it.[Applause][Ellen DeGeneres:]Ok, I’m with you on –[Kanye West:]'Ye is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay.[Ellen DeGeneres:]I’m with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money.[Kanye West:]We’re in a renaissance period. We’re in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We’re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked.You know, people never write, \"Kanye’s pissing everybody off.\" They try to position that through the media in some way that I’m like, \"Whatever.\" Whatever your friends might say, you know, \"I saw Kanye.\" \"How was he? Did he…?\" I care about people. I care about– my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he’s a psych major. My mom was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University. I was raised to do something, to make a difference.[Applause]To take– you know, I didn’t take the Oscars as a joke. It was funny. You know what I’m saying, it was like the moment. All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. \"You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it, bam! Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.\"I didn’t take it as a joke. \"It ain’t no joke,\" as Rakim said. It ain’t no joke. \"I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.\" That’s what I was raised on – Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip-hop, expression. \"Hip hop started out in the park…\"Everybody’s trying to… I don’t give a fuck how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio. Are you connecting? Picasso is dead. Steve Jobs is dead. Walt Disney is dead. Name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them. Don’t tell me about being likable.We got 100 years here. We’re one race, the human race, one civilization. We’re a blip in the existence of the universe, and we constantly try to pull each other down. Not doing things to help each other. That’s my point. It’s like I’m shaking talking about it. I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel I can make a difference while I’m here. I feel that I can make things better through my skill set. Through my skills– I’m an artist. Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago. I am an artist. I have a condition called synesthesia where I see sounds. I see them. Everything that I sonically make is a painting. I see it. I see the importance– I see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make clothes… It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about the environment and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, \"That’s not an important issue.\" But I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit. I called the head of Payless. I’m like, \"I want to work with you.\" I want to take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes, and I want to take away bullying.[Extended applause]You know, I want to- Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the reason I was able to go so far in music. There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he was considered to be \"urban.\" The Michael Jackson. So I literally have to be Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone. After I’m dead. After they call me \"Wacko Kanye.\"[Audience chuckles]Isn’t that so funny? That people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most. They talk the most shit about the people who cared the most. I’m sorry, daytime television. I’m sorry for the realness.[Applause][Ellen DeGeneres:]Well, it’s not daytime television anymore. We’re going to take a break and we are going to come back, we’re going to play 5 Second Rule, which should be very fun with Kanye.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ellen-degeneres-interview-kanye-keeps-it-real-annotated"},{"title":"Ego","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"Oh, baby, how you doing?You know

So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualizedIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive wayAnd I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and [who] are intimidated by actual good ideasI believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creationI’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that.

We're gonna be answering questions from some of your fans, some of your friends, some of your peers. But the first question I wanna ask you, it's actually from me, so Lou from London. You're one of the most famous men in the world and I think everyone has an opinion about you - I really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. I've watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and you've really talked about this idea of not being heard. There's quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach, but I got the sense you've really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think everyone fully understands Kanye West? Or do you think you're very different to your public persona? Have you created that in some way?Kanye West:Yeah, I think there's people who understand. They see it. That's the same people who see an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming.  I think there’s people who don’t want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination. You know, most people don't understand who they are. So people's misunderstanding to me is a misunderstanding to themselves. That they don't understand that he's not being the projected version of himself. He's not what he was taught by current society or taught by this lifetime. He's evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar; it's alien to us. You know, it's easier for us shun it, than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it. It's funny that so many people that are supposed to be like so super educated love to just pick the lowest hanging fruit of a concept of fame or celebrity. as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future.LS: Talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future. A question that was submitted by one of you fans, Sam Hollis. He said, what do you consider your greatest contribution to music, but also your greatest contribution to creativity?KW: Well, I'm answering the second question first. The greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. Well, I'm sure that I've bullied myself sometimes, but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative. We're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power. And that's gonna change after me and Kim's lifetime. It's gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way.  Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I’ve tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?LS: It was about your greatest contribution to music, but maybe you don’t think like that anymore?KW: Yeah… music synthesis. Just to synthesise. To take Mos Def and bring him to the studio with Jay Z, I think is the greatest... When people say ‘oh this is backpack or this is gangster,’ or to go on tour with Roc-A-Fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like ‘Roc-A-Fella is not hip hop’ and fight against that. Now, it’s considered to be one art form. Like what Louise Wilson would always talk about, there’s this juxtaposition, high, low, these opposites and combining them. This combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being. The actual human being a thousand years from now, generally, as a race we should be far advanced. Like at the beginning of ‘Prometheus’, like how that guy was just like *chtchhhhhe noise*. He was like Mike Tyson meets Steve Jobs meets Shakespeare as a person. There was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you’re only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future, people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won’t be afraid to fight for their educationLS: I think it makes people uncomfortable, doesn't it, when people try and kind of get themselves out of their box. They see musicians as musicians and when you do fashion it makes people annetuate. This relates to a question that came in from Nick Knight - he runs SHOWstudio, who you collaborate with a lot. He talks about your bravery. He said you seem, sort of, be open to make very brave decisions. And I think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas. He gave examples like opening Black Skinhead with three black KKK hoods and not putting New Slaves on YouTube or appearing naked in the Black Skinhead video. He's interested, do these decisions feel brave at the time? Do you feel brave? And maybe what's the bravest thing you've ever done?KW: I mean, there's nothing to be afraid of, really. I don't ever wanna take to much credit for being brave. That's just a responsibility of ours, as artists, to give our truth at time. And it's just as simple as that. Soldiers are brave, they have a serious responsibility to go fight for their countries, police officers are brave, fire fighters, it's their responsibility to go into a fire. And for the rest, an artist's responsibility to give our truth. I just think more than courage or bravery, it's just, I...LS: Honesty?KW: Yeah, honesty. Maybe the answer didn't... some answers I'm gonna give are not gonna make complete sense, if you're a very literal-by-the-book person. You might find a flaw in the final finishing. I suppose you understand the just of what I'm saying. And, you know, the other day I came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think, I suppose to very calculated people. As someone as you, get 2 and 3, most people will say 5. If you put 2 and 3 in front of me, I'm gonna say: well, 2 plus 3 is five, 2 times 3 is 6, 2 divided by 3 is this and 3 divided by 2 is that and then come up with an average of all those things. And then when you say 5.76 blah blah blah, that's the thing that people marvel at. Like, wow, that really was not what I was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for. But I felt I got something more out of it and that is the calculation of the Zeitgeist. Because everything changes, every day something changes. People get so caught up in the embarrasment of changing their mind in front of someone. And one thing can change everything. So you have to put that, as a part of your 2 and 3. You don't have to, I have put it as a part of my 2 and 3 equation.LS: It's interesting you use the world visionary there. A lot of our viewers, they ask questions about that term and about the term 'creative genius'. Sam Thompson, he has this question where he said, you've called yourself that and equated yourself to these different people; Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michaelangelo. He asks, how would you define a genius in that context? But also, why do you feel the need to call yourself that?KW: Because otherwise I'm called celebrity. I'm called nigger. I'm called rapper. And when they use the word celebrity, nigger, rapper, isn't that in a positive way. And all these things, all these words,  can be used in an extremely positive way: \"what's up my nigger\", you know. But that's not the way it's used. So I have to define who I am. All of my aspirations are the things that currently only sixty-year old white people do. So I have to redefine and let people know exactly who I am and it's not letting them know by, you know, wearing a suit or letting them know by wearing a Rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap. It's letting them know by saying, \"let's start with this, I'm a creative genius\". *Laughs* It's proven and now we'll continue to prove it. When people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that. They never think about the fact that I've never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups, I would completely shhh, light the lights up. We sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it. It not a... it's not a... just a financial oppertunity, cause you need finances. But it's a form of discrimination and racism, especially with blacks and fashion. And it literally, you know, it took me, being Kanye West, to get this far in fashion. Meaning, I was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself, because no one else would have. I got this employee, that's a black guy and there will be, sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later he'll tell me something and he says it kinda, like, with his voice down. I remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybody's dad. A guy would come in and sell some cookies, but my dad was a sellsman also. So he's saying, \"excuse me, I got these cookies\" and he'd say \"yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell\". This guy, this employee, because blacks especially in America have been raised with slave mentality, don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible. And everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, it's after someone's gotta say \"look at this niggers over there\". So if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way. You'd rather put it in what's people's favorite word to use for me? Humble? But if we go on your iPhone on a dictionary and look up the word humble, eighty procent of the definition is negative. It's a controlling word. It's a way to control the masses and to control the sheep. Yeah, I think there’s a level of reality to being nice, to being cordial to people. But if you have the ability to lead, you are a leader. You have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers and your will is to help. You should not be humble, you should speak up, because this world is broken. So someone needs to say something and sometimes I just feel like the only one that's not crazy.LS: I want to ask you a question that's relatable to what you were saying. The question came in quite a lot, but it was posted particularly nicely by Aravin Sandran, he's 25 and from London. And he said, \"do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because you're a black man. Would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man?\"KW: If I was a white man that became a really successful musician, that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that I shouldn’t work. So there’s a lot of white people that if they’re really super good at something, they also get discriminated against in another field. You could be a photographer and someone would say you can’t be an artist. You could be a designer and someone would say you can’t be a musician or someone would say you can’t be a film director. As far as the advantages in life, yes, if you are born white, you have that on your gene pool. Currently because the world is controlled by whites, you have that as a 100, as an advantage, and if you add a couple of other things to it, you have a very high chance of success. Whereas, because the world is run by whites currently, if you’re born black, if you make it to something like the Met Ball or the Grammys, most likely you’ve done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there.LS: It's interesting, Simon Foxton, who's a stylist. I know you know his work. Asks the question that relates as well. He said, your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism. Do you reflect like a lot of designers do, where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work? So do you do that? Or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision?KW: Yeah, I’m convinced that I know what I like and I know that I just know. I know and I don’t care. I don’t care because anyone that is criticising, most likely they saw the 350s and acted like they didn’t like them because they’re racist and discriminatory. They’re not only racist against black people; they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, ‘Oh wait a second, that cut wasn’t that good,’ but they do enough to throw a stab at, ‘Oh that didn’t fall the right way’ or ‘That wasn’t styled the right way.’ But they didn’t do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you’re a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it’s like going to Harvard. That’s the reason why I’m in fashion. I think it’s the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty... You know whatever the fuck I’m going to say today, I’m going to say it and I’m just gonna fucking own it and that’s how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I’ll tell you how I feel... but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What’s funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It’s like a class... I mean, where’s architecture? The most energy currently is around fashion because with music, it’s in question if a song is popular, if that person is really a good artist or not. In fashion, for the most part, if someone is really popular, it’s because it’s agreed upon that they’re an amazing artist. They’re amazing at what they’ve done. People do the history on what their background is. Did they intern for Christian Lacroix? Did they work at Margiela for a period? They find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current, that’s relative, that is in touch. And fashion designers are superstars currently too. It feels like hip-hop felt to me in the nineties. It’s like, me, I’m a hip-hop artist but it’s like why are you going to the fashion world? I mean it’s just a really interesting art form. It’s just a different art form. Business is an art, the way you talk to people is art, an interview can be an art, everything is a form of art. I appreciate the critics because when I see the collection I just did and when I used the stretch French Terry that I found in Japan and I use on market canvas, like heavyweight canvas, and I put it in my colour palette and I see 64 different tones come down together, you know, I’ve created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me. So if someone was to go up to a Monet and say, ‘This dot wasn’t Louis Vuitton level,’ it’d be like, ‘What do you mean?’ It’s all an expressionist painting. By the way, you know we die. 80 years, 60 years, 50 years, you know we will die. But on that day, I lived.LS: A question that came in from Natalie Wo, it goes back to what you said about your dad. Your dad was in the Black Panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone. It was very much about racism.KW: Wait a second, is that a white person who said that?LS: I don’t know her ethnicityKW: I think it’s racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour, it’s a political statement.LS: Were you not making a political statement?KW: No! It’s a painting. It’s beautiful colours. That statement is not gonna stop the murders in Chicago. That statement is not gonna help people get jobs. That statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in Atlanta. That statement is not going to stop Zimmerman from bragging about… It’s such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, ‘You need to watch out for him. He’s taking your place.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion? That place? Is that what you’re talking about?’ So the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics - a more politically correct term ironically for racism - is racist in itself.LS:  A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that’s why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it’s a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn’t seem like you see it like that? Like McQueen’s work for example, people saw it as political.KW: Yeah, I’m not gonna let anyone score points on me. If someone asks me about something, I’m gonna block all shots and I’m not gonna take any free points. I’m not gonna have someone say, ‘Oh I heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened,’ and I would be like, ‘Oh yeah…’ No. If it wasn’t my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit, and somehow they’re giving it a credibility, I’m like well no… I don’t even want that kind of credit. I don’t want anything that I don’t deserve. I just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain. I just want a clean shot. I just want a clean bat to swing, I want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with. Every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that’s actually on the bat.LS: Do you think it would be easier for you if you weren’t famous then?KW: Yeah, being famous is like the n-word. People remind me at every meeting about how famous I am. But somehow…. No, it wouldn’t be easier. The answer is absolutely no. You need fame in order to sell your shit. That’s why people pay for advertisers. So I’m basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re-did itself and went and got a really cool designer that Anna Wintour suggested, to revitalise it and became a really big brand… Meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this, but I always approach myself in a luxury way whether it’s calling Nick Knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in Italy or begging Tessiclub which hasn’t called me back yet to use their fabrics because they do Celine and Lanvin. I’ve always fought just to have better paints to work with. When I was in high school, I was at this national competition where I did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and I lost the competition because the judges were confused. They said either it’s not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or I used watercolour in the wrong way. So I lost because of that. I don’t know where those judges are today but…LS: It wasn't the best feedback. You mentioned Anna Wintour and I wanna bring her up. She actually sent us a question for you. She said, what will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older?KW: I don’t have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don’t know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they’re beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, ‘How can I make my son feel that?’ Because once you’ve felt that, none of these fucking questions matter. When you’ve missed that last bus before, when you had the opportunity to get on the bus, you don’t give a fuck about any of this.LS: When have you felt that?KW: When I’ve missed the last fucking bus! Going through the streets of Chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot.LS: Do you still get that feeling today about different things?KW: No, it’s almost like not feeling anything. It’s almost like being numb because of what I went through. There’s an employee that I’m about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking. Then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn’t know that people actually took showers by themselves. After someone’s been through something like that, they could give a fuck less about fuck. It’s just like... be real. None of this facade.LS: Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family? But also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised?KW: Yeah. And that’s the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can’t outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they’re like, ‘Wow, it’s a possibility that he’s thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.’ So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you’re in, you’re going to worry about raising kids. But it’s champagne problems too. There’s people who can’t feed their kids. That’s something more to worry about. So I’m not going to sit here and complain about the so-called issues I have. These aren’t real issues. There’s people at war. There’s people trying to make it to London right now. It’s really fucking serious. You guys are talking to me about some celeb shit. That’s not real shit. You know what? I’m alive. I’m breathing. I did a show. We sell it. I’m doing a second collection. I have no problems.LS:  Talking about the bigger things that do change who you are and completely affect your work. Carine Roitfeld, the stylist, she ask how has becoming a father changed the way you work?KW: Well, the way it changed who I was... Three years ago, after this interview, I would have been on a train back to Paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration. And now, I’m on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration, that’s my daughter.LS: A lot of people have asked about your daughter. A particular one has to do with having a daughter and how it's changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song. And the way you talk about women in your songs. That question came from Ashley Geevers. She asked if having a daughter specifically affected the way you depict women in your music.KW: Having a family period has completely made me rethink the way I rap. You know people extend their brand for a long time. There’s true moments of genius and then there’s just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together. So many people rate ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ as one of the best albums. And ‘Yeezus’ and ‘808s & Heartbreak’ are so much better and stronger. ‘Dark Fantasy’ is almost like an apology record. ‘Power’ was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single. It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months - it took over two years to release the album - but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging. People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it’s great, you don’t want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner. But you take ‘808s’ or ‘Yeezus’ where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things. So it’s that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it’s so great and they’re really happy that you did something they liked. And then you’ve got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future. Give them your innovation.LS: And having a family gives you more motivation to do that? To be more true to yourself?KW: No.LS: That just comes from you?KW: I just love my family.LS: You talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity. Do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music?KW: Of course. I’m Michelangelo. Of course. There’s a time when I’m sure there were people sculpting better than Michelangelo, but he made David. So as far as that question goes, is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes? Well go fuck yourself then if it isn’t and don’t ask me no stupid shit like that again. With the love.LS: Do you ever experience self-doubt?KW: No.LS: Never?KW: No.LS: Even when you were little?KW: No.LS: Okay, good to know. One thing that came in from a lot of people: they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody. They want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that.KW: I’m not H&M, I don’t have giant factories. How can I get the price point to what I need to be if I’m running an eight person design team... I’m saying it’s going to take time to get there. This is what I’m saying when you don’t have the right tools. This is the question that everybody has to ask. If you had the Celine design team and the Nike design studio and the Zara factory, could you do everything that you thought you could do? And what would everyone’s answer be to that? Yes. But if you don’t have the Celine outerwear person or the factory or you don’t have the entire adidas studio and you don’t have the marketing team or the sales team, you can only do what you can do. And we are doing a lot with what we have. What we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe. My wife. She’s like MTV and NBC and all this combined. Number one on Instagram. And then the entire family. And then you have me and my entire music family. Basically, there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed. That is the fucking reality of 2015 people!LS: Does that make it easier to care less about critics? Because as you say, it doesn't really matter what they say. The percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one Instagram post from Kim.KW: Yeah you know… I mean, what can I say about them? I appreciate everyone’s opinion, but I refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself.LS: What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring?KW: I’m not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I’m just... I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, ‘What about this one mum? Or this one?’ And they were always too expensive. The ones I liked when I was five. So I just want to be five years old. I loved clothes before I even knew a fuck about the fashion world. And I can’t let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason, or purpose, or a lack of purpose, or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who I am when I was five. When my grandfather had a store in Oklahoma and he’d go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices. He’d go and re-do people’s furniture, he was a carpenter also. He took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother Donda in 1949. He was predicting the future in 1949 and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put 50 cents in his hand and told him he was out of there. He raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a PhD and became the first black female chair of Chicago state University. And then had a son that she then named Kanye which meant the only one that would go on to combat every form of thought, of tradition, that the media have presented up to that point. So tell me about other people’s opinions again?LS: Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce? Or were there other influences? It feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self, which obviously came from your family. Or am I wrong?KW: I can’t say where my creativity came from. I’m blessed to be talented. I would say that came from God. My ability to give a fuck about somebody’s opinion came from my family. My ability to fight for my creativity came from my family. I’m sure people would just take that Michelangelo comment I said earlier and would take offense to that and think ‘Whoa, he still won’t stop.’ Let me just explain the justification of that. The proof of that. Ask any musician, period, of the past fifteen years - and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were be the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand? Look at the few opportunities I got to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, Nike, Adidas, really established companies and the level of love and impact people have for that product. That had proper infrastructure. So I had to take the money I made from being the motherfucking Michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds, and basically building a sculpture studio. So I wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low-hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at.LS: Why run for president? You have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas. Everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now. Other great leaders, Gandhi, Mandala, never needed to be elected to make a change, so why do you feel the need? (Caden Roberts, 14)KW: Mandela got elected.LS: Yeah, he’s fourteen, give him a break.KW: Okay, I won’t start cursing at him. Certain things that I’m compelled to do in life, I don’t feel the need to find justification for.LS: So you’re definitely going to do it?KW: Yeah.LS: When you made that announcement, was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it?KW: It had been talked about a lot for the past five years and talked about with my team and I decided I was going to announce it then.LS: Do you think Barack Obama has done enough? A lot of people have asked you that.KW: I don’t want to make comments or give opinions on what other people have done. I think he’s done a lot of great things and I think that there would be no chance of people even considering the concept of me running if he hadn’t have won.LS: Will you run with a party or will you run alone?KW: I don’t have all the answers right now.LS: What do you plan to do? What are the some of the things you really want to do when you’re in leadership?KW: I’d like to sit with engineers and come up with solutions and alternatives for people without opportunity that end up having to go through desperate measures or feel like life isn’t worth living or that other people’s lives don’t matter. I think that the way I collaborate with people and the way I empower the people I collaborate with is a different way to look at problem solving for the world than a normal political way. I just want to ask questions. I’ve already decide that when I’m on debates and I don’t know I’ll just say ‘I don’t know, I’ll get back to you with that’ and I’ll just consult with the top ten, top five people on the planet and if there isn’t an absolute right answer I’ll say ‘These are the two highest answers that we came up with right now,’ because it’s not about me. It’s we. That’s the whole purpose. It’s the skill set that brought me back from the original Taylor Swift moment, the skill set that took the little kid in the pink polo to the top of the rap game. That skill set that took a Nike designer and three Adidas designers and made the hottest shoe. The skill set that brought by wife to the cover of Vogue. All of these journeys that… Like these questions say, these absolute, like, this can’t be done, have been almost self-serving and that’s where it gets the I-I-I. It’s from me and it’s from my family. My family meaning my direct family, but what happens if there is a certain point where it doesn’t become about me and my family but my family becomes the human race. I can do all the fight, all of that confidence, all of that problem solving, all of that asking questions, all of that trying to find the best answers, and listening through… If I could maybe do that to help more people and you can help more people in a position of power to go back to the gentleman’s question earlier. These are just now in a theory form, but I am speaking from the heart.LS: A few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about 'No one man should have all that power.' It’s interesting, you just said you can change your mind, you can be wrong about things. Do you sometimes feel your own ideas have changed so much in the years you’ve been working?KW: Of course because you get new information.LS: Does it frustrate you though? Because people are inevitably going to draw the parallel between the lyric and the fact you’re going to run for president.KW: That’s not frustrating. There were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach, not really embracing... But no one’s being like ‘Man, I know I saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day, will you be respected as a designer?’ I designed that shoe, didn’t I? I don’t see somebody else’s shoes getting lined up for. I think there are a lot of fourteen year old, fifteen year old, twenty-five year old, thirty-five year old people that respect me as a designer.LS:  I met you at a dinner in Paris with Riccardo Tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind. You said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class, and no one was talking about it. I found that really interesting because I come from a radical background, my father was a Marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals. Can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further? (Bobby Gillespie)KW: Yeah it’s... class is education. People not having the opportunity to be educated. The biggest thing that made me the uncontrollable whatever is simply by being educated. Simply being educated made me uncontrollable. It’s not that I needed to be controlled. I needed to be helped, I needed to be supported. I don't wish negative on anyone. I want positive for everyone. I want everyone to win. I don’t want to be in a competition with anyone. I just want people to be their best selves and live the happiest lives possible. If you keep information and opportunity away from people, certain people, a group of people, then it’s destined they will stay at a lower class. The combination of that and being American. Because I found sometimes when I’ve worked at other design studios in London before, I find that because of the way the government is set up, people won’t have the opportunity to say they will run for being the Queen. I’m going to run for the Queen! That’s from birth. And you couldn’t be the president of United States because you’re not a United States citizen. So it sort of circumcises your dreams from day one. Whereas American is like a land of opportunity when people can work their way, climb their way up through the class system. But to be truly honoured as a black person in what is a classless society, the final house in the suburban community with the white picket fence and to be looked at as an equal is still a lot of mixed kids away from that. But the world is mixing. Period. So in a thousand years, the world might just be completely, what would be known as black currently, but it would just be a new race, except for people whose main goal and focus at that time is to keep the purity of separatism. But I see the future as people being mixed. I think that other races are really attracted to each other and always have been, because I believe that we’re meant to, but taught to not. I was taught to never bring a white girl home when I was eight years old. But I like white girls. I liked black girls too but I still liked white girls. It was such a taboo. I’m sure, like I said in the Tyler song ‘I know you told your daughters don’t take home Jerom.,’ I’ll tell you from my single days that white women like black guys, I tell you that, but I think there’s something amazing about mixing the cultures and the amount of informations that both cultures bring to the table. Or three cultures or four cultures. You ask a girl and she’ll say: ‘I’m German and Portuguese and  Asian.’ Just when I gave you that right now. What do you picture in your mind? There are probably guys gong: ‘Ah shit, I have to meet this German-Portuguese-Asian girl right now!’ They already picture someone beautiful. Just by me naming different races together and having the idea that a woman is saying that she’s mixed with these, you picture automatically someone beautiful.LS: A lot of people asked about your vision for the world and what you’d like it to be like. It seems like that mixing of ethnicities and cultures is the most important thing to you?KW: I’m not telling people who they should sleep with. I’m just zoning in on what I feel today.LS: Do you feel like if you haven’t dropped out, you would be where you are? Because I think education is important but maybe the ability to opt out of the system is also important.KW: I think I would be further and more dangerous. Yes, education is important. I’m envious of people who have read multiple novels and multiple philosophy books. I wish I had more information. I’m thirsty for knowledge. I’m busy with my own ideas. I want to pick up a book and see something that sparks me and it makes me think of thirty things I want to do and I’ll put down the book and start working on that. I’m envious of information. So college dropout… Now me at my age I’m looking... OK what were the reasons why I lost money when I did this? What was the reasons why I failed at that? It all came to not having the playbook, to not having information. With me, when I work on fashion I’m sitting here in the woods trying to chop down trees screaming screaming at the top of my lungs: ‘Can somebody just throw me some water?’ and everyone’s sitting laughing at me. That’s the fashion world, that’s the fashion critics. Me sitting here, trying my absolute hardest and everyone just laughing at me. And only one person coming up with a camera and Nick shooting a shot that then shoots across the world and they say ‘Oh he’s working with Nick Knight,’ and then Pat coming in doing the makeup, they go: ‘Oh, he’s working with Pat,’ or Riccardo coming in and saying: ‘No you can’t talk about Kim, this is my friend right here,’ they say: ‘Oh wow, the hottest designer likes Kim.’ Then the fashion world is like: ‘Hmm maybe it’s okay.’ And then they come again and say: ‘What do you think we can capitalise off of this in some way? Well come, come! We can capitalise and shit!’ But they definitely were not fucking letting me in the shows, and fucking constantly laughing at me, and trying to keep the joke going. But you know, there’s a lot of tsunamis and earthquakes that hit where people were joking on the beach. So keep joking on the beach.LS: The Kim thing is interesting to me. I feel, particularly working in fashion, I feel like I’ve watched it happen, the period where people were so critical and now they want her in their shows, they want to dress her they want her on the front row. That must upset you in a way because she’s your wife and as you said you love her. To see that U-turn, in a way, it’s great, because it shows how much people respect her and they can see how amazing her influence is, but also that back-handedness. Is that difficult? Because you must feel protective.KW: It’s always, always… it’s better now than it was and I feel happy about that.LS: We got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers. He talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting. He said do you feel that’s still a problem within music?KW: Yeah, it’s funny. Isn’t it so funny how just the culture of different art forms is so different? I felt that I got discriminated against in fashion also for not being gay whereas in music, you definitely get discriminated against if you are gay. It takes some amazing talents to really break down that barrier. People don’t have a problem with white rappers now because Eminem ended up being the greatest artist and everybody thought that when Frank Ocean’s album dropped, that people were going to be like, ‘No, this is bad for his career,’ and he’s one of the greatest writers of all time... I feel like it’s so cliche to speak about him particularly related to this subject but there always are the people who broke the ground and I think he’s the one that broke the ground. People don’t give a fuck. They love his music so so much. It’s the people that break the stereotypes that make history but I just thought it was interesting to point that out about the fashion world and the music world and just culturally, it’s reverse discrimination.LS: How did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman? (Willo Perronc)KW: You know the first thing I did think of is I thought about black radio hosts maybe possibly making jokes about it because the black culture is generally so homophobic. News cycles are just constantly… They’re just trying to find some news and some interesting things like, ‘This rapper has this transgender person in his family and…’ But then I was like fuck what people say. Fuck what people think. I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come. I just feel like whoa reality show… like that’s so fucking new of an art form to the point where my wife and their family should have had plenty of Emmy’s by now. But reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the Mondrian wouldn’t let Run DMC and motherfucking Will Smith stay there because they were rappers... or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it’s the longest running and the most popular and everybody I know watches it and shit. I feel proud that not only my contribution of the credibility that I gained and garnished from music - and just my general social opinions - that I could be next to a wave of thought of this is who I am. And that is all I’m about. Like fuck, to let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life. Meaning like you want to turn this way but there’s a car right here, you want to turn that way but there’s a car right there, you want to go a bit faster but there’s a car right in front of you, you want to just stop, cars start honking at you. That’s public opinion and Bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to. Oh sorry, it’s disrespectful to use that name but I’m still getting acquainted with what’s politically correct because it’s new, it’s modern. This is like Roman times, bro, this time that we have - this 100 years - is really the beginning of the future. We finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to... Look at the new pope. It’s a bunch of dope motherfuckers out here that are just pushing towards the future. It’s funny that I went to this train of thought off of Willo’s question because he is one of, if not the most important person in my creative growth. He is my number one instructor. He is the reason why I was able to know who Nick Knight was. He is my greatest home tutor and educator. As I said, I felt like I had the spark in me but Mike Tyson needed a custom model, Hercules needed that little trainer guy in that movie... He is my greatest cultural coach - as far as Helvetica fonts go - and operatic stages and you know honing and training and riding bikes around Paris and analysing and philosophising about you know where the future can go. And the whole idea of Donda and what we do with design and the way we’ve simplified things. Album covers are important again, stage shows are important the signs, long, only sonic outros to songs… This is all like an extension of my times and my trainings with Willo.LS:  Hundreds of people asked this. Next album: When’s it actually coming? Tell us about the name. What are you trying to communicate with it?KW: Well as I said when I first said that name, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna keep that name but I just felt like I didn’t want to walk around with the name So Help Me God for the amount of time I was working on the album. I just felt like that was a heavy backpack to carry. ‘SWISH’ just kind of lightened the load so I could let it be whatever I want it to be. So I could just work on the painting and find something which... actually me and Nick today… He just showed me a piece. I could say the idea but I was really inspired by some things and you can find the purpose through a painting, through a video, through a conversation, through a sunset, through a really tragic headline and it’s like I was collecting these vibes and just things that I liked but the album had no purpose. And it was finding something that’s like, wait a second okay, it can go to something like this, I always wanted to do this. I did Cool Summer because I wanted to shoot surround vision. I had this idea and for people out there who don’t know what surround vision is, I was performing with Jay Z one night on Watch the Throne and I was just looking at how the whole audience were experiencing the performance and I thought of this theatre experience where it was a screen above us, below us, to the left of us, completely peripheral, to the right of us, and three screens in front of us and then we made this gyroscope system and put iPhones on it and recorded some kids running across the street. You saw them on this side, then you saw them in front of you then you saw them on that side. You heard them (because we had a multiple speaker system), you saw the ground below you and you saw the sky above you. Two weeks later, we went to Qatar and shot a film… My idea - because I couldn’t get money from movie houses - I went to Def Jam and said look, I’ll just do an album and the whole point was to get the budget. I was thinking this should be easy, you know, I’ve got all these rappers on my record label and blah blah blah. Then I ended up having to rap on seven songs and taking a while to finish the album. It still has a lot of amazing songs and the idea was I wanted to do an album that’s more commercial on purpose. I want to show that I can make radio songs because before that it was 808 and Dark Fantasy. It was very heavy. I want to show I can do something that’s lighter. I gave you this whole example to say the reason that I did the album was just so I could shoot that film.LS: A lot of people are asking about the films and what’s happening with them and when they’re going to get to see them.KW: Hopefully, yeah… I’m working on some ideas on how to be able to bring it back. I don’t want to make an announcement yet of when I think I’m bringing Cruel Summer back but we’re working on something right now.LS: In a lot of your last interviews, you focus so much more on fashion rather than music. It seems like your album has been delayed because you’re working on your clothing lines. Is fashion your main passion instead of music? Does music not excite you in the way it did a few years ago?KW: No, it doesn’t excite me like when I heard Wu Tang. Of course it doesn’t excite me like that. It doesn’t excite me like when I was using auto-tune for my first time. It wasn’t my first time because I did it on College Dropout too. There were things to prove. There were purposes. There was Lauryn Hill and Dead Prez. There was this idea of mixing this kind of messaging meets the hotness of Rockafella and proving that this was a possible thing. I am an inventor. I am an innovator. It’s fine for other people to proliferate on an idea but I get excited by ideas, not by responsibility. So sometimes when I’m even writing a rap, it starts to feel like a big responsibility. If you look at Andre 3000 - one of the top five greatest rappers of all time - the majority of the time, he actually only had to write one verse... so as far as doing three verses, sometimes you start to feel more like you’re doing a talk show every night than doing some type of prophetic, every two year speech. I believe that there’s raps that I had that meant everything and I believe that there’s certain raps that were hot and there was something that meant something about hearing something that was just hot. So I’m not gonna say it meant nothing, but it meant nothing for lack of a better way to describe it, you know. People could want so many things out of you and you don’t want to let people down because of Michelangelo comments and things. You want to deliver genius, you want to prove people wrong, you want to prove people right that are fighting for you. And sometimes creatively because I’m held to task by the highest critics of every genre of art, I feel like I’m one of those guys that hundreds of years ago, they would steal something and their form of death would be to be tied to four horses then they’d whip all the horses at the same time and they’d pull the arms out of their sockets each way. That’s how it feels when I’m getting pressure from all the different angles. It feels like my arms and legs are being pulled out of my body at the same time.LS: So there’s no chance the album you’re working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure?KW: I’d never call out what would be the last. I'd call out what would spark more inspiration. I will think of a philosophy or think of something I want to say. I think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe I want to abstract the way you even hear rap. A lot of people liked the original of ‘All Day’ better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later Picasso works. Oh yes, as you guys know, I think I’m Picasso also or the closest thing to it. So lesser, equal or maybe even better. Maybe there’s something that’s more Cubist about the way I rap and that’s what I’m trying to find where. It’s like do you really need to paint every angel wing in? Their paintings weren’t completely finished. And here’s another thing. The majority of the things that are popular now are really directly based on something that I’ve done over the past ten years. You can pinpoint it. Like that was that album or that song.LS: Does that annoy you?KW: I think it’s amazing. I think I had a purpose. That was my purpose: to innovate. So if you hear something that sounds similar to something that I’ve done before, that is an extension of a new album for me.LS: So a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented, do you often see yourself in the work that they’re making?KW: Yeah, completely.LS: So people you’ve talked about working with or you’ve cited in conversations - Drake, Young Thug, all these different people - do you see that in their work?KW: I’m not trying to specify people but I just feel like there is a lot of influence and you can almost pinpoint the moments when things happened. But also, I was heavily influenced by Radiohead and James Brown and Coldplay and Jay Dillon and Jay Z and Tribe and Pharside and Dr Dre or Quincy Jones or Teddy Riley. So all of that was in my work too.LS: With your lyrical process, is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you’re saying, like with each line, or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song?KW: It totally relates to what I said earlier about finding... You know, I think that abstraction…  I wrote this thing down the other day. I hope my words don’t get in the way of how I feel, my meaning. But words, fuck, you know, it’s an extremely powerful tool that can be… I just like abstracting music. I like to listen to Coltrane and say this is amazing. I feel an era of that. I feel a rise of that, possibly coming after so many words.LS:  A lot of people really relate to specific words. Carl Swaygan said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and PTSD and he said your music has got him through a lot. He asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it’s your own music but he talks about when you’re feeling anxious or you’re feeling down or you’re feeling depressed. What do you turn to?KW: I just talk to my wife.LS: What did you do before that?KW: Talk to my wife. Or talk to my would-be wife. I talk to my friends. I just talk. I get really explicit, you know, with the way that I feel at that time. I’m extremely open. That way, I can sweat the anxiety out. I open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what I’m worried about or say, ‘What are we doing? If this is a game or this is a war, how many soldiers did we just lose? What can we do differently to win and to prove everyone wrong?’ I appreciate naysayers. I appreciate non-believers because also sometimes it’s weird for me when people do believe in me. Like someone’ll come up to me and be like, ‘Man, I believe you’re like Basquiat.’ People say stuff like that to me and I’ll just be like, ‘Wait a second, only I can say that about myself.’LS: That’s a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like, ‘I Am A God’, this sense of you being a divine power, does that scare you? Does that freak you out? Lots of people wrote in and they said lovely things like his music’s got me through the hardest time, he stopped me from committing suicide, he stopped me from fucking up my life. But you must feel a sense of pressure from that when people treat you like you are this kind of god to them.KW: The reason why I made the song ‘I Am A God’ is so those people that feel less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves, that God is inside all of us. It wasn’t about specifically me. it was about us as a race; that we are an extension of God, that we all have god inside of us.LS: One question that came in a lot was: If you could give yourself advice now to when you were dropping out of college, what advice would you give?KW: There’s so many things that had to happen for me to be sitting here with you right now. It wouldn’t be truthful for me to give a statement as arrogant as ‘I wouldn’t change a thing’ because when I sit on a long flight to Paris, all I do is wallow in the things that I wish I could have changed, things that I would have tweaked. So as far as the college thing - I don’t seem to wallow on that that much but if you asked me a straightforward question about it, I’d say the more education, the better. The more you know… Well, sometimes you can know too much especially if you don’t have the opportunity to do things and it can drive you crazy. And that’s a bit of what the Yeezus period was like. To know that I was simply not succeeding due to lack of resource, due to lack of assistance, and to have shown so many times that you had an ability but for people to doubt your ability because you’re not playing your position; the position that they want you to play. You’re not tall enough to be centre or something like that.LS: What was the scariest moment of your life?KW: Probably my car accident. A lot of time, I try to find answers that are like, ‘Mmm I wouldn’t have expected that.’ But yeah, that was pretty scary.LS: You talk about luxury and about the only luxury we have being time. What do you spend most of your time doing?KW: Working on luxury. That probably is it. I do spend the majority of my time working on my goals to create this creative ecosystem that allows a bunch of ideas to flow through them. I’m sure Nick [Knight] could probably relate to that. I probably spend the most time on trying to create something that allows me to create everything.LS: Thinking about improving the world. One question that made me laugh. It came from Boris Johnson, who the mayor of London. What would you do to make London better?KW: Widen the streets, cause they get really scared.LS: How do you think your portrayal through lyrics, visual, quotes of the black woman formed pop culture’s understanding of black women? And do you think it is within the function of contemporary black male rappers to uplift their female counterparts in the face of adversity?KW: I definitely think generally, rap is misogynistic and it’s just a part of - not saying it’s justifying the culture - I definitely think I’ve said ‘Bitch, get out the car’ in some of my lyrics and stuff like that. And is there a responsibility? I feel like rap, for the 20 years that I’ve studied it, it’s only, as a whole, responsible to trend. So the only way that specifically what she’s talking about would be hurt more if it was more in style. Rap is a communication of trend. It’s a communication of the way people are in real life. It’s a communication of what someone just said to their girlfriend on the phone or an argument they just had or something positive that just happened. What I notice is, there was a time when we had afro-centric rap and everybody was like how common is. It was like ‘my queen, this, that.’ You haven’t even heard the word ‘queen’ so long in that context. What I’ve noticed is when I come home from a meeting with some head of a studio and I just get completely dissed and I show them a bunch of creative things - like on Despicable Me where he was trying to show his mum he could make a rocket and she was like whatever, that’s weak. That’s how it is going to meet with people in Hollywood and showing them your ideas. They just shit on you, like ‘We don’t need that, it’s weak.’ And I’ll come home and I’ll find myself being more irritated and maybe being more rude with my wife. So let’s take that to the idea of a black male in America not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at Starbucks and he goes home to his girl and… Just to think about my frustration and if I was rude to my wife because of that, we are like super well off to the point where this guy is like, ‘I can’t take my kids school shopping if I knock my manager the fuck out if he says this to me one more time.’ They cannot drink the Ye juice at all. They cannot turn up at all. It’s like you scream at the person closest to you. This song that Chief Keef put out that I sang the chorus on - I was singing I scream at you cause I can’t scream at nobody else - and then take that and you go to a studio and that frustration and disrespect is now coming out towards the woman next to you or the women around. Like we can’t wife you, you’re just a thot, we can’t do this, blah, blah, blah. And the guys around are just like, ‘You’d better not say that to them or I’ma shoot you.’ It’s from lack of opportunity. It’s from being inside of traffic - that thing I told you earlier - that lack of ability to see a way out and you just start being frustrated inside of that space… and then you go into the studio and that’s what it’s gonna sound like. ‘I’ma shoot you, fuck you, bitch’ because that ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from America. That ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from our lack of opportunities. That ‘nigga, I’ma shoot you’ came from racism which is an amazing tool. It’s like if you could put racism in the battery of your phone, it would never stop working. It works on itself. It’s residual and shit. Residual racism is to be in a racist situation where you’re working at this fucking job downtown blah blah blah, they’re treating you like shit, and you go home and you’re just mad at everybody. It’s like black people don’t even like black people at a certain point. Racism is the hate that keeps on hating. And I said this thing, I was sitting with Steve McQueen when we showed our piece that we did on ‘All Day’ and it we put it in the LACMA. Let me say that again just to purely be a dick because I said that knowing it was a stunt and very intellectual. So me and Steve McQueen… I think it’s a very impressive thing to say shit like that right after saying nigga, nigga, fuck, fuck, wee, wee, wee. I said I just embrace racism. He just looked at me like what the fuck do you mean you embrace racism. I was like no, it’s here. This thing is like we’re in a jail cell. Are we gonna keep fighting this? How do we just embrace what’s in front of us as opposed to always pinpointing that it’s the reason you’re being held back? But I realised in order to truly be one of the greatest artists and one of the most remembered artists - I’ma get off the social subject and switch it more into the art and fashion context again - is that same assistance that I begged for and got frustrated for… The fact that I’m starting to do it without some of that assistance is what makes it truly historical and what demands the respect. And that’s the reason why even in the beginning, there’s like an intellectual olive branch of your show had more meaning than just being an oversized sweatshirt. I refused that intellectual… Get that fucking branch out of my face. I ain’t gonna take it. I ain’t gonna take the meaning that you proposed upon me. This is what i meant and if it’s not good enough for you, then fuck you. My Aunt, one time, she let me see Robocop and my Dad was really strict and I came home and was about to tell him and she grabbed me and said, ‘You’re really a glutton for punishment, aren’t you?’ Almost like a masochist or some shit, right. And like in a way, I am. I kinda like pain, I like the challenge, I like making things harder for yourself because if you can beat the game on the hardest mode possible, you’ll be the best of all time. So that means if I become a good designer as a black straight American entertainer, rich dude, all the type of shit that says you shouldn’t be able to have any creative thoughts, then it’s like the ultimate fucking win. Then you’re like Eminem or Tiger Woods or Barack Obama, just someone who just completely broke all boundaries... And it’s exciting. This interview is exciting because it’s such a battle of perception and a battle of the intellects and a battle of culture and a battle of class, a battle of taste. It’s like y’all motherfuckers know I’m gonna win this battle. It’s so fun though. It’s so fun. Because the whole trick I always say is I’m an artist and an artist can basically take on any shape, form and an artist can paint anything. So when I’m like opening up the Yeezus mountain on tour and stuff with the Margiela mask… you know, some nights in the middle of one of my rants, I’m just like I’m sorry, the gig is up. I was actually never really a rapper, I was always an artist and that’s the reason why I’m just killing this shit so hard right now. So when you talk to the lighting guys, it might not come out as good but don’t feel bad because I’ve been trained since age 5 and went to college for this shit. It’s always like that secret thing, you know. It’s about sharing information. Jews are a culture that share information. That does not happen in the black community. For your family, your son, maybe. Day one, this is how this community works. This is how we grow together. And that racism, slave mentality, nigga mentality, show off mentality, I’ma fuck your bitch mentality, all that is like what makes a culture that has all the highest physical attributes going for it the weakest due to simply - like that speech DiCaprio gave on Django - simply removing the esteem and that is why I refuse to fucking back down. You have to know that you are somebody. You have to know that it’s possible whether you’re creative, whether you’re a black person in America, whether you’re a black person in London, you know, you have to know it’s possible. You have to see me keep winning against all odds. I will win until I die. I won’t lose. I can’t lose because then it’s like they win; ‘they’ meaning the mentality, the old guard of thought because we’re just a thought. A hundred years from now, we’re all just memories.LS: Do you feel it’s true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding? In some ways, what you’re saying, you sound super positive but in other ways, there is that sense of pessimism and people not understanding. Do you think that statement’s true?KW: Well, I’ve said a bunch of wild shit and my wife hasn’t left me yet so let’s hope not. But I think there will be someone who will understand everyone. I don't know. Maybe there is a someone for everyone. I’m trying to be overly positive.LS: I can’t really think of anything profound that I don’t already know about you… so here’s a really simple question that I actually don’t know. What would your last meal be? (Kim Kardashian West)KW: Oh it’d definitely be some of of her home cooked fried chicken.LS: Going back to the women thing, it’s a question I want to know. Would you say you’re a feminist?KW: I think I’m a humanist. Is that a party? But yeah, come on, like so many black kids in America, I was raised majority by my Mum. My Dad was around - I would see him in the summers and the springtime. But I think I fight for the importance of any community that is not being properly accredited - just period - of anything. This statement is going to sound kinda gay but I’m gonna say it. I love older white men, but basically if you’re not an older white man, you don’t run shit. It’s always gonna be more of a fight for anyone that isn’t an older white man. Period. So I like to speak on behalf of people without a voice and sometimes that could be a creative, sometimes that could be a woman, sometimes that could be a man turned into a woman. My dad five years ago would live in a homeless shelter to counsel with ex-drug addicts and, you know, he really cares about people. It’s like as soon as he moved to where he is now, he was like how can we improve the water here? How can we improve the education system? I just met this girl. She’s in this situation with her family. This and that. What can we do to improve this? That’s all he cared about. It’s caring about people. So there’s something where it’s like I live my life, I get to be a rockstar, a rapper, this, that, and then at a certain point, it’s at that moment where you just look and you see people dying and being on top of their roof and you just look at the camera and say George Bush doesn’t care about… and that’s like my dad and that’s my mum. I’ll go to a football game and I’ll be looking at the game and I’ll watch the score and I look at the human score meaning like the 50,000 people there and I start to zone in and think like where did this person come from? What did they go through? What type of job have they got? What brought us all here today? What are their interests? It’s like sometimes that part of my dad comes out of me that starts to get really intrigued with who people are. So even when I design, I am going to make the Apple of clothing. I don’t think there’s a purpose of saying you want to do it because it’s obvious I want to… But want is like this politically correct way to word your future accomplishments. This one guy was super snobby with me at a fashion dinner, of course. And I explained to him that there was a time when people said I couldn’t rap and he asked me, ‘Oh, so is this what you hope to do in clothing?’ I was like I don’t hope. I execute. As far as apparel goes, I will make the Apple of apparel and the Apple of apparel isn’t high street. It isn’t fast fashion. It isn’t a $9000 sweatshirt. It’s the thing you want to keep for the rest of your life. Just looking at human beings, sometimes you present things, people don’t even know that they want it yet. I could show you two photographs. I’ll show you a really well-known designer that’s highly respected blah blah blah that I pulled as a reference to proportion because they had this silk jacket. It almost looked like a lining fabric. If I describe it too well, they’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to say the person’s name but it had like denim on denim and like a sock on a shoe and different things like that. It was after I did my sock shoe. And I had a photo I had just done and the guy had an olive jacket on, cotton on cotton, self-lined, a tank top… The colour, I probably couldn’t even describe it, almost an orange but really subtle, and the shorts are like some beautiful light brown with a bit of grey in it and the guy was black that the clothes were on. And everyone who I showed those two images together, now, the one image, you even know who the designer is and it’s top five designers in the game and you see this image right here. And I’m like which one? And people always pick this one because of the colours and people don’t even understand how important colour is as an opinion in clothing. Give a fuck if I got any of the cuts right on the last collection. Anyone who doesn’t say ‘I had an emotional connection to the colour palette’, they don’t even know how to see anymore. They don’t even know what they’re looking at. They see clothes and they’re looking at numbers. They’re not feeling emotion. They’re thinking about trend. They’re not seeing future. They’re not seeing luxury. They’re not seeing time like oh shit, I wanna go to the park with my family. I’ll just throw this on. That’s what I want to do: is present something that gives people some of their time back because it works together like Lego and you just throw it on. And I’m not saying that I mastered it by season 2 for Christ’s sake. I didn’t hit ‘Watch the Throne’ and ‘Dark Fantasy’ on my second mixtape. But the theory is there and only I can do it. Only i care about it that much. Only i have the exact 2 and 3 code in my head. I could say it out loud. I could say oh this army surplus but look at how far we jumped from army surplus in the second season. So just think about where we’ll be by season 3. Look at how far we jumped. Cause I have the code in my head. You have to cut open my head and take my brain and put it on top of some big organisation and you can’t. It’s like completely, you know, that sweatshirt, that T-shirt decision I’m making is a piece of my mum having me at Operation Push at age five, it’s a piece of my dad going to the homeless shelter, it’s a piece of my grandfather having a store where he fixed furniture in the back, it’s a piece of my cousin bootlegging cross colours out in LA, it’s a piece of my Aunt that was the chicest woman that I knew. Even when she had Alzheimers, she would dress better than the entire family and I remember the colours and they remind me of the colours that we were able to find. We were able to start to find and penetrate this concept by the second season without being held back by the fabrics that were available, to do all-black and only have a navy blah blah blah. I don’t use blue. It bugs me out.LS: Tell me about the colour blue.KW: Yeah, I hate the colour blue. On this collection, Katherine Hamnett was emailing me about how I had to have blue jeans and how I’d need to have a white shirt and this and that about… I was like I guess I could see how I would need that but like I said, I like to make it harder for myself by just doing what I want to do.LS: You say you like to make things hard for yourself and you’re so driven and you’re so passionate. You’re obviously ambitious. Are you happy?KW: So so so so happy. And I’m happy for the normal reasons to be happy because I married the woman of my dreams and I have a beautiful daughter and so many beautiful people around me and my cousins and families in different states - there’s so many loving people. I have a son on the way. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I have the opportunity to be completely rogue and to be able to support myself being who I am exactly and now I’ve even opened up a whole new place to create by being able to do apparel and then going in and doing film and being able to take those horses that at one point were pulling in all these different directions and pulling my arms out of my sockets and re-aim them in one direction and have the most powerful four horses running towards you; that tsunami about to hit, that earthquake about to come in. Some people might not see it and for the people who don’t see it and don’t understand what’s about to happen, you know, certain people are visionaries, certain people are early adopters, certain people are just followers. So I take it that the most negative reaction is from the followers.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-in-camera-live-interview-annotated"},{"title":"Improvise","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"[Verse 1]There must be more good women than men percentage wiseSo her chance of having a husband just minimizeThat's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guysAnd mess with other girls part time to improviseI knew she wouldn't vibrateNo I seen her inner eyesBut I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighsShe telling me about how black people should enterpriseAnd I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterpriseThat I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5With the gas fully filled up like I didn't driveTold her I had a girl, nah I didn't lieTold her this rap game is alright.

What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, \"no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval.\" So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin', like I've calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people could've had the proper information. And just to speak to the Dave LaChapelle, 'cause Dave LaChapelle's one of my favorite photographers, modern-day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, \"Okay well he has a god complex.\" Fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, it's because of my position, it's like I'm not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look it's my face! It's me! And sometimes it's like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit that's exciting to me. So the Rolling Stone's cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it was't speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesn't care about Black people and then people took it and said, \"Well you said, \"Bush hates Black people.\"\" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, \"Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?\" And I'm like I'm not really political dawg, I'm not getting into like you know I'm taking sides and this type of thing. He's like, \"What do you mean you're not political? You're not...\" I was like, fam! I'm emotional! I'm social! I'm like... I'm an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, I'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. I'm the glitch in the matrix, I'm like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know I'm supposed to feel like this and know I'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesn't put me... I'm never going politically incorrect or anything. I don't know about politics like that. I just know about people. I make music for people","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-interviews-interlude-lyrics"},{"title":"Interview Magazine: Cover Story Excerpt","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"MCQUEEN: You've been on the scene as an artist now for 10 years, which is impressive, given the level of interest and artistry that you've managed to sustain in your work. In the process, you've become incredibly influential. So you talk about doing all of these other things, which is great, but there's really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now. So my question is: What are you going to do with all of the influence that you have right now?WEST: Well, influence isn't my definition of success—it's a by-product of my creativity. I just want to create more. I would be fine with making less money. I actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things. Not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger, or trying to show people how many Louis Vuitton bags I can get, or buying my way to a good seat at the table. My definition of success, again, is getting my ideas out there. The first company that has really given me a shot is Adidas. They did the deal ... I mean, Damon Dash did the deal, at the end of the day. He signed Kanye West 12 years ago. What does that mean now?  What does that mean to music? You know, people say things about creativity and jobs and every 10 years, blah, blah, blah. But I don't have a desire to not continue making music. When I left Chicago and moved to New York, it wasn't because I didn't love Chicago; it was because I needed to go to New York. So right now, I've got other innovations and other thoughts that I want to pursue. As I was saying earlier, I create like a 3-year-old. When you're 3, you wake up one morning and say, \"I wanna ride a bike.\" And then the next day, you wake up and say, \"I wanna draw.\" I don't want to be in a situation where, because I was good enough at riding a bike one day, then that's all I can do for the rest of my life. I mean, you know firsthand, being a fine artist and then moving into the Hollywood space ... You know, I say to Renzo Rosso, Bernard Arnault, and François-Henri Pinault, the heads of Diesel, LVMH, and Kering, \"Come to my show and look at the mountain I made. Look at these 20,000 people screaming, and then tell me I don't deserve to design a T-shirt.\" If I want to design a T-shirt in my lifetime, then please help me do it! People say, \"Well, why don't you just do it on your own?\" Are you telling me to sew every single T-shirt? People say, \"Why do you antagonize the high-end companies and your fan base?\" and this and that. But what I'm saying is that in working with partners like Louis Vuitton and Zanotti and Balmain and Fendi like I have—and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because I hate when people do that with music—I feel like it's a better form of film that I'm working with when I work with them. I'm working with better cameras. I'm working with better editors ... Steve, please forgive me because I feel like it's super-patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work inMCQUEEN: No, not at allWEST: I'm sorry. I find it super-insulting whenever people give me a music analogy. It's like, \"You know, I would have understood it if you just said it in English. You didn't have to put it in music terms, like you somehow know more about music or I would understand it better if it were in music terms.\" So please forgive me for putting that in film terms. I mean, talking about film to Steve McQueen ...MCQUEEN: [laughs] I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States. When was the first time you came to Europe? Do you remember?WEST: I think it was when Damon Dash had me and some other Roc-A-Fella artists come over. He stressed the importance of connecting with London, especially. Then we went to France, and I hated France when we first went there. Now, of course, I love it. But at the time, there was a rapper out of Chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his, and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if I didn't show up because we had done a record together. And Dame Dash had to man-up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back, just for me to be able to get on that first flight to LondonMCQUEEN: It's interesting how when Malcolm X ventured out of the United States for the first time, he went to Europe, he went to Africa, he went to Mecca, and then, when he came back to America, he realized that, to some extent, for him, it wasn't about black or white, it was about people. In talking to you now, it seems like you feel the same way—that it's never really been about race for you, but at the same time, it has very much been about that, if you know what I meanWEST: My mission is about what I want to create. It's for people, for humanity. It's about things that can make the world better. I'm not saying that I'm going to make a better world; I'm just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I'm facing is based on my color. You know, I was looking at some cheesy-ass MTV videos a while ago, and it was so funny because it was like, \"Wow, these videos are pre-Michael Jackson\"—and people forget that Michael Jackson had to fight to get on MTV because he was considered to be an urban artist. This was, like, the greatest pop star of all time, and they told him, \"We're not gonna play your video because it doesn't fit our format.\"MCQUEEN: It actually stunned me to find out that you've never won Best Album at the Grammys. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but it's kind of odd, considering what you've done in music over the last decadeWEST: I wasn't even nominated for Best Album this year. This year, I only got two nominations by the Grammys: for Best Rap Album and Best Rap SongMCQUEEN: Well, that's my problem with all this stuff. It's ghettoization—and I'm talking about country as much as rap. It's all just music. And I've got a problem with people kind of trying to categorize it, where it's either good or it's bad. I find it all odd, to be honest. Have you ever been nominated for Best Album?WEST: I've been nominated for Best Album maybe three times. I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne less than a year apart and neither of them got nominated. \"Ni**as in Paris\" [off Watch the Throne] wasn't nominated for Best Song either. But let's go into the fact that I have the most Grammys of any 36-year-old or 40-year-old or whatever, and I've never won a Grammy outside of the Rap or R&B categories. \"Jesus Walks\" lost Best Song to some other song; \"Ni**as in Paris\" wasn't nominated in that category. But those are the labels that people want to put on you. People see you in a certain way, so if I was doing a clothing line that had rock tees in it or whatever we just did for the \"Yeezus\" tour, which sells $400,000 of stuff in two days ... You know, I like Shame [2011] as much as 12 Years a Slave, but Hollywood likes the idea of a black director directing 12 Years a Slave more than it likes the idea of a black director directing Shame","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-interview-magazine-cover-story-excerpt-lyrics"},{"title":"In God’s Country","album":"DONDA: WITH CHILD","artist":"Kanye West","number":"5","lyrics":"[Lyrics from Snippet][Kanye West]Free out the steam[Justin Bieber]Oh-oh-oh, ohOh, I love youIsn't this just what I stress [?]","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-in-gods-country-lyrics"},{"title":"","album":"","artist":"View Tracklist Lil GenocideFree - Marie Antoinette WrightKanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestLive From Irving Plaza NYFunk Flex (Guess Who’s Back Freestyle)Jesus WalksThrough the Wire (Still Standing)Two WordsShow Go OnChampionsLive From Tweeter Center, IL (Interlude)The BouncePoppin’ TagsA Million and One Freestyle’03 Bonnie & ClydeB R RightBrown Sugar (Fine)Good to YouThe Good, the Bad, the UglyDead or AliveTakeover FreestyleGot NowherePoppa Was a PlayaHomeReebok CommercialHeavenIn Cold BloodMy WayYou Made MeMy LifeGhettoThe TruthThis Can’t Be LifeNothing Like ItIzzo (H.O.V.A.)

Every time I say something that’s extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet. So what are we getting all of the rest of the time?I don't care about having a legacy, I don't care about being remembered. The most important thing to me is like while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep, in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can I do, what can I do with my voice, what can we do for each other to make life easier, to make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow. You know, we were born into a broken world, we're like the cleanup crew, you knowMy mother made me believe in me. When I was growing up I wanted make video games. My mom got this Amiga computer when I was in seventh grade and it had 4,096 colors. I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes, it would stay, place another note. It would stay, place another note, and it's how I learned how to produce. In seventh grade I was just really making music to make video games. They just let me dream, they supported me, they pushed me, they didn't set me up to be inside of a box. Weston main thing that makes magic magic - the fact that no one believes it's possibleWhen I entered the fashion world and I encountered a lot of elitism and all that it just made me happy. It was something fun, we had the entire world against us. It was like absolutely no allies. Whatsoever, you know what I mean, it was like the world was against us, the pressure of that was like crazy, was like a Super Bowl. I remembered sitting there with my fashion publicist Debra and we're supposed to do the resee, these is the thing with the editors after the show so they come back to see it and see if they like the collection, and we had like two or three people that came to see it and take picture with Kanye and bla bla etc. I say \"Do we have more editors coming\", and Debra just look and says \"No, no one else is coming\", and I looked at her and said \"This is great. Remember this moment cause it won't always be like this, embrace this moment when no one came to see the collection\". I take things that people look as a negative as an inspiration to do something betterI think there are school teachers that are at the exact same mission as as me. I think there's police officers with the exact same mission as me. It's just help, it's just do everything you got, give everything you got, and, you know, our focus needs to be less about what our legacy is gonna be or how we're gonna control each other but more how can we can give to each otherKanye West on Being The Robin Hood of Fashion*Somebody please transcribe these*Kanye West on Why He's Not in a Competition With AnyoneI'm not in competition with anyone. None of us will be remembered. You know, our existence as a race, humanity in period is a blip, another second of our life in the entire scope of the universe. All these walls to keep us from loving each other as like one family, as one race, you know, racism, religion, you know, where we grew up, whatever it is, class, social network, economics, you know, all this. What makes it be so selfish, prideful, all mixes now want to help the next man, what makes us, you know, be so focus on a personal legacy as opposed to an entire legacy of a race, you know like, the dinosaurs are remembered from much more than their bones, you know. So for humanity's gone what do we give to even this little planet, you know, now wrong, and what can we do collectively, like removing the pride*Somebody please transcribe the rest*","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-interview-for-time-100-lyrics"},{"title":"Kanye West’s Grammy Honors","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"Grammy AwardsWon2005 Best Rap Album: The College Dropout2005 Best Rap Song: Jesus Walks2005 Best R&B Song: You Don't Know My Name by Alicia Keys2006 Best Rap Song: Diamonds from Sierra Leone2006 Best Rap Solo Performance: Gold Digger2006 Best Rap Album: Late Registration2008 Best Rap Song: Good Life2008 Best Rap Album: Graduation2008 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group: Southside (with Common)2008 Best Rap Solo Performance: Stronger2009 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group: Swagga Like Us (with T.I., Jay Z, & Lil Wayne)2009 Best Rap/Sung Collaboration: American Boy by Estelle (feature)2010 Best Rap/Sung Collaboration: Knock You Down (with Keri Hilson & Ne-Yo)2010 Best Rap Song: Run This Town (with Jay Z and Rihanna)2012 Best Rap/Sung Collaboration: All Of The Lights (with Rihanna, Kid Cudi & Fergie)2012 Best Rap Song: All Of The Lights (with Rihanna, Kid Cudi & Fergie)2012 Best Rap Performance: Otis (with Jay Z)2012 Best Rap Album: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy2013 Best Rap Song: Niggas in Paris (with Jay Z)2013 Best Performance: Niggas in Paris (with Jay Z)2013 Best Rap/Sung Collaboration: No Church in the Wild (with Jay Z, Frank Ocean & The-Dream)","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-wests-grammy-honors-lyrics"},{"title":"Kanye West - 47th Grammy: Best Rap Album Acceptance Speech","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"And the Grammy goes to...

Fantastic,” Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie NickersonMcQueen related how the project came about“Me and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, ‘I’m at Dover Street Market, where are you?’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m at Dover Street Market,’” he recalled. “I always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That’s Kanye: It’s been a wild ride.”The director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, “So Help Me God,” and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-topsIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity“As a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn’t been for my experience in Paris — learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,” said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. “It’s part of the show,” he pleadedWhile a divisive figure in fashion — many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior — West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people “that work here, the city itself, the music that’s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.”West’s ties to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009More recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included “All of the Lights” and “Ni–as in Paris.”A tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. “When I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,” West saidTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charityMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after“He fully got the color right. And it’s so perfect, I’m like, ‘Don’t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,’” she said with a smile. “I’m happy with it. It’s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, ‘Huh, what’s going on?’”Kardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration“I’ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair.

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forthJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' withSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"No ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"[Saxophone Solo]I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back thenI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"[JAY-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]And I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]Dame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wowI got 11 plaques on my walls right nowYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"So won't you raise your glass, won't you...So won't you raise your glass, won't you...So won't you raise your glass, won't you...So won't you raise your glass, won't you...","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-last-call-lyrics"},{"title":"Late (Live at Abbey Road Studios)","album":"Late Orchestration (2006)","artist":"View Tracklist Kanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestDiamonds from Sierra Leone (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Touch the Sky (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Crack Music (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Drive Slow (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Through the Wire (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Workout Plan (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Heard ’Em Say (Live at Abbey Road Studios)All Falls Down (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Bring Me Down (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Gone (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Jesus Walks (Live at Abbey Road Studios)Gold Digger (AOL Sessions)Kanye WestGeorge KerrSylvia RobinsonLate","number":"11","lyrics":"[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]\nLittle girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)\nPlease stop your crying\n\n[Interlude: Kanye West]\nThat is why A-Trak is a five-time world champion DJ\n'Cause he can fix any fuck-up, and, uh\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Whatnauts]\n(I'll be late for that) I'll be late for that, I'll wait for that\nHad a taste for that, I'm messin' up too, but, uh\n(I'll be late for that) 'Cause I'm comin' in when I feel like\nSo turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right\n(I'll be late for that) I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that\nI think I was made for that\n(I'll be late for that) So I'm comin' in when I feel like\nSo turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right\n\n[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]\nLittle girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)\nPlease stop your crying\n'Cause I'll be late for that\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nI was flyin'\nMade it to school with barely enough time to sign in\nYeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom\nYeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one\nThey say the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West\nThere's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get\nNot even electives?

with you, but the vibe is wrong\nAnd that haunted me, all the way home\nSo you never know, never never know\nNever know enough, 'til it's over love\n'Til we lose control, system overload\nScreaming, \"No, no, no, n-nooo!\"\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nSee I wanna move, but can't escape from you\nSo I keep it low, keep a secret code\nSo everybody else don't have to know\n\n[Hook]\nSo keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown\nKeeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown\nYou keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown\nYou keep your love lockdown - you lose\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nI can't keep my cool, so I keep it true\nI got something to lose, so I gotta move\nI can't keep my-self, and still keep you too\nSo I keep in mind, when I'm on my own\nSomewhere far from home, in the danger zone\nHow many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?\nYou lose, you lose\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nSee I had to go, see I had to move\nNo more wasting time, we can't wait for life\nWe're just racing time, where's the finish line?\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nI bet no one knew, I got no one new\nKnow I said I'm through, but got love for you\nBut I'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nGotta keep it going, keep the loving going\nKeep it on the roll, only God knows\nIf I be with you, baby I'm confused\nYou choose, you choose\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nWhere I’m bout to go, I don't need you\nI've been down this road, too many times before\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\n\n[Hook]\n\nSo keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown\nSo keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown\n\nIs anybody in the house right now in love right now?\nIn love right now, well keep your love lockdown\nIf anybody in the house right now is in love right now\nTry your best to keep your love lockdown\nKeep your love lockdown\nKeep it on\n\nIs it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?\n\nThis brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller\nThank you for\nBeing my shrink today and the stage as my couch\nThank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind\nThe ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night\nAnd just for this moment as I hear clap and hear you scream, just for this moment\nI feel alright\n\nMy pain shall be your pleasure, my torment and tragedy\n\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nSee I had to go, see I had to move\nNo more wasting time, you can't wait for life\nWe're just racing time, where's the finish line?\nWhere’s the finish line?\nAre we at the finish line?\nRunning for the finish line\nRunning for the finish line\nAre we at the finish line?\nAre we at the finish line?\nAre we at the finish line?\nAre we at the finish line?\nYou run for the finish line\nYou run for the finish line\nI’m not ready to fi-finish life\nBut I’m on the finish line\nSo I run from the finish line\nI run from the finish line\n‘Cause I’m not ready to finish life\nI gotta run from the finish life\n\nSo keep your love lockdown, so keep your love\nYou keep your love\nWe’re low…\n\nNot loving you, way I wanted to\nWhat I had to do, had to run from you\nI'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong\nAnd that haunted me, all the way home\nSo you never know, never never know\nNever know enough, 'til it's over love\n'Til we lose control, system overload\nScreaming, \"No, no, no, no, no, noo\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nWhat I had to do, had to run from you\nSo I keep it low, keep a secret cold\nSo everybody else don’t have to know\n\nSo keep your love lockdown\nYou keep your love lockdown [3x]\n\nSo keep your love lockdown [3x]\nYou keep your love lockdown and you lose\n\nIs anybody in the house right now that’s in love right now?\nYou gotta keep your love locked down, you gotta keep your love\nPromise me, promise me, promise me, promise me\nPlease, please, promise me\nPlease, promise me, please\nThat you will keep your love lockdown\nJust try to keep your love lockdown\n\nYou don’t want to make the music\nI’m forced to make right now\nI know it sounds good and all\nBut I would rather have my love lockdown\nThat number one hit don’t mean shit\nIf it’s nobody to celebrate with\nTo celebrate with, to levitate with\n\nYou gotta keep your love lockdown,

Seventh grade, I wanted to be on the basketball team. I didn’t get on the team, so that summer I practiced. I was on the summer league. My team won the championship; I was the point guard. And then when I went for eighth grade, I practiced and I hit every free throw, every layup, and the next day I looked on this chart, and my name wasn’t on it. I asked the coach what’s up, and they were like, “You’re just not on it.” I was like, “But I hit every shot.” The next year — I was on the junior team when I was a freshman, that’s how good I was. But I wasn’t on my eighth-grade team, because some coach — some Grammy, some reviewer, some fashion person, some blah blah blah — they’re all the same as that coach. Where I didn’t feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say, “Because I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team!” I’m letting it out on everybody who doesn’t want to give me my credit.[JC] And you know you hit your shots.[KW] Yeah — you put me on the team. So I’m going to use my platform to tell people that they’re not being fair. Anytime I’ve had a big thing that’s ever pierced and cut across the Internet, it was a fight for justice. Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn’t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly. It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play. You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, “This is wrong.”[JC] You’ve won a lot of Grammys.[KW]“[My Beautiful] Dark [Twisted] Fantasy” and “Watch the Throne”: neither was nominated for Album of the Year, and I made both of those in one year. I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person.But the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate.[JC] You want the historical record to be right.[KW] Yeah, I don’t want them to rewrite history right in front of us. At least, not on my clock. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. But after a while, it’s like: “Wait a second; this isn’t fair. This is a setup.” I remember when both Gnarls Barkley and Justin [Timberlake] lost for Album of the Year, and I looked at Justin, and I was like: “Do you want me to go onstage for you? You know, do you want me to fight” —[JC] For you.[KW] For what’s right. I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things. So when the next little girl that wants to be, you know, a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world, and it’s time for us to roll out and say, “Did this person have the biggest thing of the year?” — that thing is more fair because I was there.[JC] But has that instinct led you astray? Like the Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, things like that.[KW] It’s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That’s all it is.[JC] So no regrets?[KW] I don’t have one regret.[JC] Do you believe in the concept of regret?[KW] If anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.[JC] But that is something that you apologized for.[KW] Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure....[JC] That’s fascinating, to look at that record through that lens.[KW] I don’t have some type of romantic relationship with the public. I’m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti. That was the album where I gave people what they wanted. I don’t think that at that point, with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers, that I could’ve done “Black Skinhead” [from “Yeezus][JC] Does that make “Dark Fantasy” a dishonest album in some way?[KW] It’s always going to be 80 percent, at least, what I want to give, and 20 percent fulfilling a perception. If you walk into an old man’s house, they’re not giving nothing. They’re at 100 percent exactly what they want to do. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I’m sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don’t even know when you’re being compromised till after the fact, and that’s what you regret.I don’t want to come off dissing “Dark Fantasy.” It’s me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth. As much as I can air things out for other people, to air things out for myself, to say, “I feel like this could’ve been stronger.”...[JC] Even though you had always wanted to be out in front, was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity?[KW] Yeah, I held on to the last moments of it. I knew when I wrote the line “light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson” [from the song “Slow Jamz\"] I was going to be a big star. At the time, they used to have the Virgin music [stores], and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, “I’m soaking in these last moments of anonymity.” I knew I was going to make it this far; I knew that this was going to happen.[JC] But producting happened for you first, especially after Jay-Z used you so heavily on “The Blueprint.”[KW] I used to have tracks that sounded like Timbaland; I had tracks that sounded like [DJ Premier]. But Jay-Z was an amazing communicator that made the soul sound extremely popular. And because I could make the soul sound in my sleep, it finally gave me a platform to put the message that my parents put inside of me and that Dead Prez helped to get out of me and Mos Def and [Talib] Kweli, they helped to get out of me: I was able to put it, sloppily rap it, on top of the platform that Jay-Z had created for me.Before, when I wanted to rap, my raps sounded like a bit like Cam’ron; they sounded a bit like Mase; they sounded a bit like Jay-Z or whoever. And it wasn’t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make, you know, raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write “All Falls Down” in 15 minutes.[JC] Is that true?[KW] Yeah, that’s how I discovered my style. I was just hanging out with them all the time in New York. I would produce for them. You know, I was able to slip past everything with a pink polo, but I am Dead Prez. And now, because I was able to slip past, I have a responsibility at all times.[JC] What were the things that you were trying to do on “Late Registration” that you either did not or could not yet do on “Dropout”?[KW] I was trying to do different things with orchestras. It was just a vibe that I was trying to get at, a sound I was trying to mix with hip-hop to try to see how far I could expand it. I guess that was a Chicago thing, like Quincy Jones.[JC] But you came here, you worked with Jon Brion [the Fiona Apple producer].[KW] I really liked the sound of some projects that Jon Brion had worked on. I was always considered this crazy hothead kid, but I would always just go and just really break bread with someone who I respected. I will completely bow to anybody I respect.[JC] That era also includes what I find probably the most moving thing that you’ve ever done, which is calling out President Bush at the Hurricane Katrina telethon. To me, that moment is actually the peak of putting a message in a pop format, even though it’s not a song.[KW] Yeah. I guess it’s a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation. I mean, my dad’s generation is a generation of messaging, you know? But that’s just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that I am.[JC] Were you conscious that that’s what you were doing, or was it totally just instinct?[KW] Yeah, it was pretty bugged out. When you think about it, I was wearing like, a Juicy Couture men’s polo shirt. We weren’t there, like, ready for war....[JC] You look at Jay or Diddy, and I’d say like, 90 percent of the time, you think they’re having a good time. With you, I would say, I don’t know, 50-50 maybe? Or 30-70?[KW] Maybe 90 percent of the time it looks like I’m not having a good time.[JC] But you’re in a very public relationship, a seemingly long and satisfying relationship: you’re about to have a child.[KW] Any woman that you’re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It’s actually easier to focus, in some ways.[JC] When you’re uncertain about love, it can be such a distraction. It infects all the other areas.[KW] Yeah, that’s what I mean when I say like, “Yo, I’m going to be super Zenned out like, five years from now.” I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.[JC] On “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” there’s a really affectionate scene where you go and help Kim sort through her clothes.[KW] That was from a place of love. It’s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways. You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help....[JC] One of the things I thought when I heard the new record was, “This is the anti-'College Dropout.’ ” It feels like you’re shedding skin. Back then, you were like: “I want more sounds. I want more complicated raps. I want all the things.” At what point did that change?[KW] Architecture — you know, this one Corbusier lamp was like, my greatest inspiration. I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room, and it just had the worst acoustics possible, but also the songs had to be super simple, because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass, it’s not going to work in that space. This is earlier this year. I would go to museums and just like, the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit, and I visited it like, five times, even privately. And I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about, you know, why did they design it? They did like, the biggest glass panes that had ever been done. Like I say, I’m a minimalist in a rapper’s body. It’s cool to bring all those vibes and then eventually come back to Rick [Rubin], because I would always think about Def Jam.[JC] His records did used to say “reduced by Rick Rubin.”[KW] For him, it’s really just inside of him. I’m still just a kid learning about minimalism, and he’s a master of it. It’s just really such a blessing, to be able to work with him. I want to say that after working with Rick, it humbled me to realize why I hadn’t — even though I produced “Watch the Throne”; even though I produced “Dark Fantasy” — why I hadn’t won Album of the Year yet.This album is moments that I haven’t done before, like just my voice and drums. What people call a rant — but put it next to just a drumbeat, and it cuts to the level of, like, Run-D.M.C. or KRS-One. The last record I can remember — and I’m going to name records that you’ll think are cheesy — but like, J-Kwon, “Tipsy.” People would think that’s like a lower-quality, less intellectual form of hip-hop, but that’s always my No. 1. There’s no opera sounds on this new album, you know what I mean? It’s just like, super low-bit. I’m still, like, slightly a snob, but I completely removed my snob heaven songs; I just removed them altogether.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-new-york-times-interview-excerpt-annotated"},{},{"title":"","album":"","artist":"View Tracklist Mark SpitzView All Credits Kanye WestBetter Than YoursChase the DevilChase You Outta HereLuciferEncoreYou Don’t Know My NameSlow JamzKnock Knock RemixWouldn’t You Like 2 RydeMe Against the MusicKeep the ReceiptRap City FreestyleStand Up (Remix)Dogs OutDoin’ My JobTurn Ya Self In’03 Til InfinityThrough the Wire (Remix)YouCertified GangstasExtravaganza","number":"12","lyrics":"[Intro: Kanye West]\nLong Beach, stand up!

Don’t let nobody but you\n\nYou know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I’m uncontrollable or something. Like I don’t do what I’m supposed to do. You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are\n\nCuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star\n\nYou know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies\n\nYou know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight. We goin’ out of control tonight. Ahh\n\nHow many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\n\nNow with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn’t fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\n\nSee this is what I’m talking about.This is what I’m talking about. This is what I’m talking about. I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking about\n\nHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?\n\nYou see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not — [to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, [crowd chants “Kanye”] people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I’m not going to say no names or anything\n\nBut if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?\n\nAnd they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”\n\nThat’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will\n\nAnd I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terrorist\n\nYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do.

But this year, we gon’ piss on ‘em, on they motherfuckin’ port-a-potties.How many of y'all don't give a fuck about what the press say? It's 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know y'all seen movies and shit. But y'all livin' a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.You know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. I'm like, 'Little ol' me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why y'all scared of me?!' Why they so scared of me? … Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. What's the new shit out? What's the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Let's just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until I'm super old. Not until I'm super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until I'm super old. So I think it's time—hold up, f—k that toast.But I promise y'all tonight, as I stand here, 37-years-old, this is only the beginning. This is only the beginning … Because in all honesty, I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now, this might not come off as humble, but I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. I ain't concerned about nobody that's actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but that's the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When I'm talkin' 'bout Walt Disney, when I'm talkin' 'bout Howard Hughes, when I'm talkin' 'bout Henry Ford, when I'm talkin' 'bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And I'm only 37. And right now I'm rockin' to 90,000, of y'all motherfuckers right now. So I ain't goin' at anybody on the radio. I'm goin' after Shakespeare. I'm goin' after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going after David Stern. I'm goin' after Henry Ford. I'm going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but he's my boy. Whether you believe it or not … you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe … And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe … I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times … And I know that I ain't perfect. But everything I'm not makes me everything I am.I came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin' daylight was comin' on. They said I was runnin' late. They blared my motherfuckin' tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote 'FUCK KANYE' on that shit. Y'all wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Y'all gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin' they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, I'll run that shit. This is real rock n' roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? I'm from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.Somebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was God's plan. God's plan. God's plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, it's all in God's plan. God's plan. God's plan. God's plan … So whether you believe it or not … the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me—but not in the Webster's definition of humility. It humbles me in a way that gives me strength, to know that it's in God's plan.

I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most\n\nYou know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?\n\nI had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true\n\nCause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low.

I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!\n\nI ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering\n\nCause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming\n\nI feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world\n\nHow many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO [??] YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-dreaming-and-success-lyrics"},{"title":"","album":"","artist":"View Tracklist View All Credits Genius2015 The Breakfast Club InterviewPresidential Campaign Rally Speech South Carolina July 2020On Being a CelebrityOn TruthfulnessOn Genius and FashionOn Albums and RadioOn Business People and CorporationsKanye vs. Paparazzi: “Mosquito Bully”Kanye vs. Paparazzi: “Don’t Talk”2013 Jimmy Kimmel Interview (Part 1)2013 Jimmy Kimmel Interview (Part 2)Twitter PoetryOn Wiz KhalifaOn The College Dropout’s 10-Year AnniversaryOn “Pop Style”On Dreaming and SuccessOn the Grammys (2)On Michael JordanOn Paparazzi, Celebrities, and ActivistsOn Creative FrustrationOn Jimmy KimmelOn the 2009 VMAsEllen DeGeneres Interview: Kanye Keeps it RealOn Bob EzrinOn Achievement and CreativityOn Meeting with Donald TrumpOn Kid CudiOn Saint Paul and Personal DebtOn Taylor Swift and ArtistryOn Fern MallisOn the 2009 VMAs (2)On MediaTakeoutOn Rich PeopleOn the GrammysOn Voting for TrumpOn Radio, JAY Z, and Mark ZuckerbergOn PoliticsOn Pusha-TOn Bonnaroo Music FestivalOn Hurricane KatrinaKanye West","number":"","lyrics":"# ok very serious question…\n\n# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?\n\n# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?\n\n# hash tag you raised Tidal’s subscriptions by a whopping 🐭🐭🐭downloads\n\n# I’m bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day… thank you dead-mow-five\n\nDo you do birthday parties??

You’re designing again, in fashion. Tell me, what’s the difference in how you approach fashion to how you approach music? Is it similar, is it completely different?\n\n[West]: Everything in the world is exactly the same.\n\n[Meyers]: Alright, great. I don’t think we’re done but I think I’m going to sign off.\n\n[West]: Meaning like, you can do comparable people like - who would you compare Daniel Day-Lewis or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to musically, or in fashion, directing, architecturally? Who was your favorite teacher when you were growing up? It’s certain people that when - that teacher when you’re in eighth grade, that this person really cared and you knew this person cared about you as a student and gave everything they had and they were meant to do that. It’s other people that were just like getting a check or something. It’s all the same. You know, for me I give you paintings, sonic paintings. I have synesthesia; I can see sound in front of me. So, when I want to do fashion, I just want to give you sculptures. So it’s like Michelangelo; the church wanted him to paint, and he just wanted to do sculptures. So the hard – the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn’t understand, I just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures. But, due to the fact that I’m a celebrity, all these different things they’re like “no, you can’t do this, you have to do this kind of line.”\n\nSo, it’s kind of the first of its kind so that’s the reason why there’s been a lot of confusion as to why I want to do it, to why is he getting so frustrated about it. It’s like: why don’t you just do music? It’s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves Béhar, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker. He can design whatever he wants and I'm like, that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative, you know, wants.\n\nAnd as, you know, get really successful at one thing you start to grow, and you're like - you feel like you can do more things, and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight, and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster. And people are like now in this day and age, if you don't believe it, it's like they're like \"No, Kanye, you can't run faster. This is the limit that was made. This is the walls that Michael Jackson broke down for you, and Jay Z and Russell Simmons broke down for you. This is the end of it. So I'm in the process, 2013 all of the controversy about why - I'm in the process of breaking down walls that people will understand 10 years from now - 20 years from now.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-creative-frustration-annotated"},{"title":"One Day","album":"The Graduate (Extra Credit)","artist":"Kanye West","number":"23","lyrics":"Lyrics for this song have yet to be released.

I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on thisI’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared.  I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared. SooooYou ain’t never seen, you ain’t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own itYou know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouthYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we hadAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. StarBut what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long timeAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you canSo I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a foolMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?I’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like thatSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalizedSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit upBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”And right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?And what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s showBut he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?But I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Mark's, and we gon’ take ’em from the streetAnd I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…Hold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now!

There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.[Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says “they’re looting.” If you see a white family, it says “they’re looking for food.” And you know, it’s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I’ve tried to turn away from the TV because it’s too hard to watch. I’ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I’m calling my business manager right now to see what’s… what is the biggest amount I can give and… and just to imagine if I was… if I was down there and those are… those are my people down there.

Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That’s my abstract take on what I know about it.\n\nSo I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It’s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?\n\n[...]\n\nIt looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.\n\nIt’s colorless also. It’s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that’s really what my style’s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.\n\nMy dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he’d get around Black people and they’d kinda discriminate against him because they’d say he acted ‘white’ or talked ‘white.’ So there are times when I’ll talk and you’ll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white’--the suburb voice come through and it’s times you’ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I’m influenced by all those things.\n\nI lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she’s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn’t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.\n\n[...]\n\nThere will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It’s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it’s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I’m the only 36 year old me! I’m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don’t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.\n\n[Do you talk to corporations like that? They don’t like being uncomfortable.]\n\nWe are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we’re being a gated community doesn’t mean that things are comfortable.\n\nThe thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we’re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There’s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.\n\nLike, politics is dead. It’s over with.

We ain't finna play with them no more. \"***Flawless\", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé. And at this point, we're tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration. We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity.

I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now.

But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump. [audience boos]\n\nNow, there’s people that I love that did vote that voted for Hillary and I don’t love them no less because they had their opinion. I love friends that I have that voted on Hillary. My manager, Scooter Braun, voted on Hillary. One of my management team. My other manager, Izzy, I’m gonna assume voted on Hillary. Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y’all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter. That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage. That don’t mean that I don’t believe in these things because that was the guy I would have voted for.\n\nRun the next song.\n\nBelieve that there are people here enjoying, or before I start talking at least, enjoying a Kanye West show. By a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a Kanye West show who voted for Trump? [audience screams] Oh, it sound differently from before, huh? It sounds different. Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn’t, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn’t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.\n\nHow that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I’m not setting y’all up, I’m not setting y’all up I’ve got no time for bullshit–what I’m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I’m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?\n\nI haven’t talked about anybody’s stances on anything. I haven’t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That’s not what I’m talking ’bout. That’s not what I’m asking you. What I’m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don’t know they might think I’m like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y’all should go ahead and….” It’s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That’s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don’t say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That’s the reality.\n\nWell, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain’t even vote? I’m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I’m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. “Aw you ain’t gonna get it now because of what you just said.” It was proof that it didn’t matter what nobody just said! It doesn’t matter!\n\nIt might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, “Oh, this rapper” because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I’m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn’t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don’t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There’s possibilities inside of books. There’s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?\n\nDon’t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president’s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don’t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.\n\nOh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That’s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That’s a woman right there saying, “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump’s campaign. That’s not supposed to happen, right? No! That’s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we’re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There’s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.\n\nI don’t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I’m not saying that, “Aw man, that just mean that anybody can win.” That’s not what I’m saying when I say 2020. I’ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It’s that, “Oh, I don’t fuck with your principles so now I’m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.” Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.\n\nMan, and you know what also? I’m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that’s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I’m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It’d be like white people that’s racist running around saying “niggas” now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I’m saying. It’s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen.

[inaudible]. I want you to explain what the problem with education is.[Summer]The problem with education is they don’t stick up for minorities or people who aren’t in [inaudible]…[Kanye]Hold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.[Audience]Yes sir.[Kanye][inaudible] then explain the issue.[Summer]My name is Summer [?]. I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…[Kanye]I know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say Mm-hmm I feel that\" or \"Mm-hmm, I feel that\". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, \"I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves\" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the [inaudible].When she says, We have completely expressed our point…[interrupted] who is that?([We can’t hear you in the back])You can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?You see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.[Kanye]Summer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go.[Summer]Okay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.There’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…[Kanye][inaudible], history.Summer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.[Summer]Is that okay with you guys?[Audience]Yes![Kanye]Wait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…Quiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.[Audience]Yes![Kanye West]So, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round.[Audience]Yes![Kanye]Inside of the very first rally. [crosstalk] I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.[Summer]Okay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.[inaudible] social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.[Kanye]Pause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.Now Summer, go ahead.[Summer]So on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.Summer: (06:04)There’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.Kanye West: (06:04)Raise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.Lauren: (06:04)My name is Lauren McLeod.Kanye West: (06:04)This is Lauren McLeod.Kanye West: (08:43)I understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? [inaudible 00:08:49]. Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.Kanye West: (09:32)And that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.Kanye West: (09:33)Wait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?Audience: (09:33)No.Kanye West: (09:33)Did you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.Audience: (09:33)Oh.Kanye West: (09:33)We’re ready.Lauren: (10:07)Education is an important topic. Education…[inaudible 00:10:07]Kanye West: (10:09)We have no microphone.[inaudible 00:10:09]. You got it.Lauren: (10:09)Education starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.Lauren: (10:42)[inaudible 00:10:42], with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?Kanye West: (11:09)Okay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to [inaudible 00:11:09], I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.Kanye West: (11:26)In Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.Kanye West: (11:34)Percocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this [inaudible 00:11:34] mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.Kanye West: (12:34)It said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.Kanye West: (12:55)Uno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”Lauren: (12:55)Okay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…Kanye West: (12:55)About pride.Lauren: (13:41)Yeah, different places in the United States are trying to [inaudible 00:13:41]. I grew up in [inaudible 00:13:41]. I repeat [inaudible 00:13:48]. [inaudible 00:13:47], they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. [inaudible 00:13:55], dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair [inaudible 00:14:03]. If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person [inaudible 00:14:09], truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.Lauren: (13:41)And I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.Kanye West: (14:51)I understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.Kanye West: (14:55)This reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? [crosstalk 00:14:59].Kanye West: (14:58)Stephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.Kanye West: (15:38)The National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.Kanye West: (16:03)Talking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.Kanye West: (16:41)In risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.Kanye West: (17:59)We pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.Kanye West: (19:15)Wait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pauseKanye West: (20:24)He set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.Kanye West: (20:47)I see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.Kanye West: (21:05)Now let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.Kanye West: (21:09)So…[inaudible 00:21:10] [inaudible 00:21:10] most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be [inaudible 00:21:26] most original languages and we, all these people,[inaudible 00:21:26]. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.Kanye West: (21:47)The statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like [inaudible 00:22:16].Kanye West: (22:19)So my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it [inaudible 00:22:23] that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.Kanye West: (22:22)So, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God [inaudible 00:22:52]. Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.Kanye West: (23:19)You already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.Kanye West: (24:03)I know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.Kanye West: (24:30)You know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.Kanye West: (24:58)[inaudible 00:24:58].Audience: (24:58)We love you Kanye.Kanye West: (24:58)I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.Kanye West: (28:50)And then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a [inaudible 00:28:50] deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.Kanye West: (28:50)My idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?Audience: (28:50)No.Kanye West: (28:50)Calm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.Speaker 1: (28:51)What about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? [inaudible 00:28:51] What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?Kanye West: (28:51)Now everyone be quiet so you can hear us. [inaudible 00:27:18]. Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.Speaker 1: (28:51)Single moms with no family. Single moms…Kanye West: (28:51)Exactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. [inaudible 00:27:47]. How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.Audience: (28:51)Yes.Speaker 1: (28:51)Kanye, I love you. [inaudible 00:28:18]. You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.Kanye West: (28:51)Let me tell you. The Bible says…Speaker 1: (28:56)The Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.[inaudible 00:28:56].Kanye West: (29:10)When I said I had…[inaudible 00:29:10].[inaudible 00:29:21]. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.Kanye West: (30:06)Amber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce [inaudible 00:30:35], I mean of getting an abortion.Kanye West: (30:39)I understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.Kanye West: (31:16)People always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.Kanye West: (32:03)Break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”Kanye West: (32:24)When a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that. [crosstalk 00:32:39] So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.Georgia: (33:00)What are you? Nothing? [crosstalk 00:33:00]Kanye West: (33:07)I am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.Speaker 2: (33:18)Why’d you delete it?Kanye West: (33:24)Because I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in [inaudible 00:33:43] looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.Kanye West: (34:00)What I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. [crosstalk 00:34:23] Does anyone know [crosstalk 00:34:23] TMZ.Speaker 2: (34:23)F*** TMZ!Kanye West: (34:23)[crosstalk 00:34:23] quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?Audience: (34:35)Yeah.Kanye West: (34:37)Okay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to [crosstalk 00:35:22].Kanye West: (35:23)I care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much [inaudible 00:35:31] because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee [crosstalk 00:35:39] this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. [crosstalk 00:35:50]Kanye West: (35:34)How do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?Speaker 2: (35:34)When we steal.Georgia: (35:34)When we lie.Kanye West: (35:34)When we steal. How else?Georgia: (35:34)When we lie.Kanye West: (35:34)Lie.Audience: (35:34)Cheat.Kanye West: (36:06)When we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. [crosstalk 00:36:25] I don’t think the last… [inaudible 00:36:29] a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.Audience: (36:53)[inaudible 00:36:53] Talk up! [inaudible 00:37:02] [crosstalk 00:37:12]Kanye West: (37:19)Wait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.Georgia: (38:04)I just think my [inaudible 00:38:04]. I don’t think we should say [crosstalk 00:38:15].Kanye West: (38:20)Let me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for [crosstalk 00:38:31]. Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. [crosstalk 00:39:11]Kanye West: (39:14)Maximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. [crosstalk 00:39:20] Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five [crosstalk 00:39:29]. We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. [crosstalk 00:39:57]Kanye West: (39:57)When you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the [crosstalk 00:40:21], bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?Audience: (40:29)Yep. Yeah.Kanye West: (40:31)Okay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? [crosstalk 00:41:02] But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. [crosstalk 00:41:12]Kanye West: (41:12)Let me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a [crosstalk 00:41:13] thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is [crosstalk 00:41:41].” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do. [crosstalk 00:42:28]Kanye West: (42:27)One second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. [crosstalk 00:42:40] wait a second. You need to hear this. [crosstalk 00:42:54] this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?Kanye West: (43:19)We got, we’re going to have to, you’re very [crosstalk 00:43:20]. Come up here, you’re third. [crosstalk 00:43:20] I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Wait a second. I must [crosstalk 00:43:20] that I did smoke a little bit last night. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. [crosstalk 00:44:26] Light up right now. [crosstalk 00:44:40] Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that [crosstalk 00:44:55] Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. [crosstalk 00:45:00]Audience: (43:19)I love Michael!Kanye West: (43:19)Oh, do we still love Michael?Audience: (45:11)Yeah! [crosstalk 00:45:11]Kanye West: (45:11)Do y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?Audience: (45:17)Yeah! [crosstalk 00:45:17]Kanye West: (45:17)Be quiet. He’s talking about opioids.Gary: (45:17)I want to talk about opioids and [inaudible 00:45:39].Audience: (45:17)Speak up!Gary: (45:17)It’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.Kanye West: (45:55)And by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.Audience: (46:13)Nobody!Kanye West: (46:14)That’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to [crosstalk 00:46:14]Gary: (46:14)I’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to [crosstalk 00:46:14].Kanye West: (46:14)What I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have [crosstalk 00:46:40] more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. [crosstalk 00:47:00] Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.Kanye West: (48:00)Because I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?Kanye West: (48:07)No that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. [inaudible 00:48:07].Kanye West: (48:07)Hey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.Kanye West: (48:07)Real talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. [inaudible 00:49:18].People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.Kanye West: (49:50)When I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and [inaudible 00:50:54] through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?Kanye West: (51:14)Because ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to [inaudible 00:52:24] people. And every time that you make a comment [inaudible 00:52:32].Kanye West: (52:53)And you are adding to the attention of them not understanding [inaudible 00:52:53]. That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?Shiloh: (53:36)I have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the [inaudible 00:53:36] free of slaves and how [inaudible 00:53:39]. Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about [inaudible 00:53:45].Kanye West: (54:36)I will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? [inaudible 00:55:17]. No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.Kanye West: (59:38)I appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting [inaudible 00:56:05].Kanye West: (59:38)You know what…you know what’s so funny? [inaudible 00:56:33]. We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.Kanye West: (59:38)Now, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.Kanye West: (59:38)I’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.Kanye West: (59:38)400 years is related to the bible. [inaudible 00:58:19] African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.Kanye West: (59:38)You probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.Kanye West: (59:39)Give me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be [inaudible 00:59:58] black church. That’s some true sh**.Kanye West: (01:00:19)Everybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. [inaudible 01:00:19]. Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings [inaudible 01:00:36]. Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.Kanye West: (01:01:12)That was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020.

Like, what are you talking about?\n\"Oh, you look real nice today\" (Nah, yeah)\nThere's only one day, by the way (All that we need)\nSo that's what we gon' do, we gon' take all the holidays and put 'em in one day\nChristmas (Mm, mm, mm, mm)\nThe doors always open\nSo imagine this, I'ma give you the visual\nWhen you wake up, every morning is Christmas\nEvery afternoon is Valentine's Day and then every night is New Year's Eve\nEvery morning is Christmas, every afternoon is Valentine's Day and every night is New Year's Eve\nEvery morning is Christmas, every afternoon is Valentine's Day and every night is New Year's Eve\nEvery morning is Christmas, mm\nEvery night, Valentine's Day, at night, it's New Year's\n(First one got ahead so we gotta chop it up to get the best version, so just—)\nTake all your favorite holidays\nYou know, I feel like in Martin Luther King Day, for his dream to really be alive\nWe have to not celebrate, because it what it does, 'cause it puts us—\nWe have to not celebrate the holiday because it, it puts us in the loop\nJust keeps reminding us of the struggles, they start pulling up pictures of us getting hit by dogs and firehoses and all that\nYou know like, my daughter came home from school, and her mother said\n\"My daughter— our daughter came home from school\"\nAnd our companion said—\nBecause, just like, I was about to say like \"our\" and \"my wife\" and \"her mother\", and that, that separates us, so we should always be together somehow\nSo we just trying this out, this is just a lil' freestyle, you know?\nThe way we can speak to each other with non-violent communication\nAlso, it shouldn't be \"non-violent\" because we should say \"non-more violent\"\nBut both of those are negative, so how can we say that in a positive way?\nYou say, um, \"healing communication\", \"sharing communication\"\nWhat's the opposite of separation? What would be a word that's the opposite of separation?\n\"Joining communication\"?\n\"Joining communication\"\n\"Our daughter arrived home\"\nInstead of saying \"My kid came home from school\"\nYou can't say \"Kid, came, that, got\"\nYou see, um, grandmothers tell you \"Don't say got\"\nYou know what I'm sayin'? What you got? Get it?\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's the dirt in the vine\nAll we, that we have (So we don't need sunshine, how would I say I need it if I got it?

broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout \"how my neck look?\"\nWell... it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\nCause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego and confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\nCause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern day MJ with a off the wall flow\n\n[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly

me when I speak\nPlease say to me something before you leave\nYou've been treating me like I'm invisible, now I'm invisible to you\nOh invisible truths they say, I can't quite understand what you say\nUnderstand, understand, understand I'm standing under oath with my hand on the book\nTell the truth, nothing but the whole truth\nAnd you always give me half of you, half of you\nTake half of a shot\nWon't you let my heart go?\nMake you feel something that I'm feeling\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether

both die brokeGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debtAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say noPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on TwitterMy friends' best advice was to stay lowI guess it's hard to decipher all of the billsEspecially when you got family members on payrollThe media said it was outlandish spendin'The media said he's way out of controlI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their controlI know I'm the most influentialThat TIME cover was just confirmationThis generation's closest thing to EinsteinSo don't worry about me, I'm fineI can see a thousand years from now in real lifeSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel likeTroll conventional thought, don't need to questionI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressiveThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the missionDid it with no permission, on our own conditionsMost blacks with money have been beaten to submissionYeezy with the big house, did it way differentNever listen to Hollywood producersDon't stare at money too long, it's MedusaThe ultimate Gemini has survivedI wasn't supposed to make it past 25[Chorus: Sampha]Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night skyWonderin' whether God's gonna say hiOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night skyAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlifeYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hiYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah[Verse 2: Kanye West]I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to comeA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drumsI believe in the children, listen to the kids, broIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, hoBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentationHe sat back and smiledBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crimeThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dimeMost black men couldn't balance a checkbookBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"Well, it all looks greatFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chainsThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hardReal family stick together and see through the mirageThe smokescreens, perceptions of false realityWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?I am one with the peopleI am one with the people (Real!)I've been woken from enlightened man's dreamCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteemLet me not say too much or do too much'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touchI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happenSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'God, I have humbled myself before the courtDrop my ego and confidence was my last resortI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beamsOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' meWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' meOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' meWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and meTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to seeI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to HovI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stoveBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go brokeOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all goWe all goNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's WaldoShe got the same

What are you trying to do with the message you're sending?It was really just my subconscious. It was a feeling I had, you know like, people, we're taught how to feel. We're taught how to think. We don't know how to think for ourselves. We don't know how to feel for ourselves. People say feel free, but they don't really want us to feel free. And, uh, I felt a freedom in first of all, just doing something that everybody tells you not to do....I just love Trump! That's my boy! You know like, so many rappers, you'll look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump, but then he get into office and now they don't love him. Trump is one of rap's favorite people right?But we talked about this, that before he was elected president, people in hip-hop it was an in thing to put Donald Trump in your rhymes somewhere.And by the way, I'm in hip-hop but I'm not just in hip-hop. I'm a black person in the black community but I'm not just that. I feel like one thing is that people try to minimize me to artist, hip-hop, black community...Yeah, I'm always gonna represent that but I also represent the world....You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sound like a choice! [laughs]. You was there for 400 years and it was all of y'all?It's like we're mentally imprisoned. I like the word 'prison', because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It's like slavery Holocaust, Holocaust Jews, slavery is blacks...So prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. That we're the human race.Do you feel that I'm being free? And that I'm thinking free?[Van Lathan]I actually don't think that you're thinking anything. I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought. And the reason why I feel like that is because Kanye, you're entitled to your opinion, you're entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact, and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said.While you are making music, and being an artist, and living the life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years that you said, for our people was a choice!Frankly, I'm disappointed. I'm appalled. And brother, I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that's not real.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-slavery-was-a-choice-pt-1-may-1-2018-annotated"},{"title":"Slavery Was a Choice Pt. 2 [May 1, 2018]","album":"","artist":"","number":"","lyrics":"we need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled painto make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free willMy point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslavedThey cut out our tongues so we couldn't communicate to each other.  I will not allow my tongue to be cutKanye vs the media is modern day Willie Linch theory.they hung the most powerful in order to force fear into the others.they can no longer stop our voice.the Nat Turner movie never made it anywhere because it showed slaves revolting. I understand why my god brother Puff calls his network revolt.if this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Natthe universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome.we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation.the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought        It was just an ideaonce again I am being attacked for presenting new ideasin school we need to learn how magic Johnson built his business not always about the past.

(Yeah)\nIn the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9\nPutting them pants on shelves\nWaiting patiently; I ask myself\nWhere I wanna go, where I wanna be\nLife is much more than running in the streets\nHoller at 'Ye, hit me with the beat\nPut me on my feet, sounds so sweet\nYes, I'm the same ol' G\nSame goatee, stayin' low-key, nope\nHoller at God: \"Man, why'd you have to take my

and them TV shows\nThat all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties\nAll turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me\nSo naturally, actually, had to face things factually\nHad to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me\n'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair\nI don't wanna ever go back there\nSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off,

Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you can't--Ellen: BeautifulKanye: And I've learned how to shut up more and, um, I've--yeah. I think--I think I'm a better human being, you know, because of herAnd because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause there's things I've done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect tooEllen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you don't seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I don't know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotionsAre grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeledIn a different wayKanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesn't have the words for it. And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. There's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that couldBlatantly see like, \"Wow, the \"Yeezys\" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give himA shot in something else.\"  And there's a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that. But the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result. So I tried something different over the past couple years. And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...Ellen: Well put. Well put. And that is true. I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves. And you do, you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing. It doesn't getThe result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is, and then you get the result because you've shifted. We have to take a break. And then we're gonna show the world premiere of your new video, which I absolutely love. I love this song so much. You actually played it for me in our living room, and I just was blown away how beautiful the song isCutEllen: So, uh, more kids?Kanye: Yeah, we're tryingEllen: Really?Kanye: Yeah, yeahEllen: I thought I'd slip that in there. I mean, that baby is so adorable, and, I mean, she is precious. She's so-- And smart as can be, right?Kanye: Mm-hmmEllen: Yeah, she's-- Oh, look at that. So you're gonna have more? How many do you want, like a bunch? Like a Brad and Angie bunch? Or, uh--Kanye: I just want whatever Kim wantsEllen: Wow. Um... That's--that's a good answer, whether it's true or not. And what is the name of the CD?Kanye: I don't know yet. We're still trying to find it. Trying to find the vibe. You know, this transition from what I felt when I did \"Yeezus\" to what I feel now, and, you know, we're just creating. So we haven't found it yetEllen: Okay. What about \"Ellen's My Friend\"?Kanye: Yeah.

Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that’s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. [?]. “You’re my M.A.S. and I’m your Nicholas.” And her brother’s a doctor. And somehow in her family she’s looked at like she didn’t do as much  in her life ‘cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit togetherAnd I honest.. I’mma jump to a point just so I don’t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I’m a Christian, I’m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we’re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we’re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they’re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, “oh, you’re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.” No knock to lawyers, but you know what I’m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” Nah, I’m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, “you think you not part of fashion because you don’t datatata.” Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let’s make the conversation, you know, let’s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl’s’ or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currencyWhen we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew ‘cause he’s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say “wow,” you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that’s word fashion insiders, but everyone’s a fashion insider, you know. It’s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it’s, the point I wanna make before I bring ‘em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design ‘cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, “Kanye you can’t get in this show ‘cause you’re a celebrity” or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley’s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I’m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I’mma say what the fuck he should’ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don’t even know if I made one fucking good pointBut what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn’t figure out where my office was. We didn’t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We’d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn’t about me being a celebrity ‘cause it could’ve been like, “what do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..” All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I’m closing now. I don’t move, I don’t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don’t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I’m so happy that Jeremy is here ‘cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I’m not gonna say shit else. So all I’mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-dailys-fashion-los-angeles-awards-speech-lyrics"},{},{"title":"The Joy (HW Version)","album":"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Record for Hype)","artist":"View Tracklist View All Credits Kanye WestHell of a Life (HW Version)Dark Fantasy (HW Version)POWERChain Heavy (HW Version)Ghetto UniversityThat’s My Bitch (HW Version)Runaway (HW Version)Lost In the World (HW Version)Gorgeous (HW Version)Monster (HW Version)Holding Me Back (HW Version)Devil in a New Dress (HW Version)So Appalled (HW Version)Blame Game (HW Version)Sweat on My FaceThe Makings of YouEverybody Loves the SunshineThe Joy","number":"13","lyrics":"[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]\nAdd a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Woo!)\nA great big expression of happiness\nBoy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh) with a dozen roses\n(Mr. West) Such would astound you\n(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you\n(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Woo!)\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]\nPete Rock, hit me one time\nI give 'em my life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine\nThey wanna give me gray skies, get me drunk\nGet me high, get me something to get me by\nI gave her a handshake, only for my man's sake\nShe in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake\nNow there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)\nAnd she want me to cum all over her damn face\nI never understood Planned Parenthood\n'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood\nTaking refills of that Plan B pill\nAnother shorty that won’t make it to the family will\nIf I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will\nThey ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel\nDon C. just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad\nBut I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had\n\n[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]\nAdd a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on)\nA great big expression of happiness (Ow!)\nBoy, you couldn't miss (Uh) with a dozen roses\n(Kanye) Such would astound you\n(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you\n(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nNo electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto\nYou know the demo, your boy act wild\nYou ain't get the memo?

What would he learn?\n\nWhen the rich man hopping out the Lincoln Town Car, passes by the homeless person\nAnd they actually talk to each other\nWhat would he learn? What would he learn?\n\nIf a black man, that came from Chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people, ‘cause you do not want to be accused of being gay\nWas to talk to a gay person\nWhat would he learn? What did I learn?\n\nI learned that people in Chicago was wrong\nAnd I’ve been an asshole all along\nA lot of things that you learn are wrong\nSo don’t be an asshole too long, too long, too long\nYou can’t be an asshole too long\nYou can’t be an asshole too long\n\n‘Cause the more you know, the more you grow, the more responsibility you have show what you know\nAnd give everything that you got to give, baby that’s the reason God let me live through the accident without practicing\nOkay, got to bring this up and bring it back again\nOkay, okay, okay, okay\nAlright [7x]\nNo publishing Outkast, please\nAlright [5x]\nShout out to three G’s\nOne of the few dressed quite as fresh as me","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-touch-the-sky-live-from-vh1-storytellers-lyrics"},{},{"title":"Touch the Sky","album":"Late Registration (2005)","artist":"View Tracklist Lupe FiascoJust BlazeView All Credits Kanye WestWake Up Mr. WestHeard ’Em SayGold DiggerSkit #1Drive SlowMy Way HomeCrack MusicRosesBring Me DownAddictionSkit #2Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)We MajorSkit #3Hey MamaCelebrationSkit #4GoneDiamonds from Sierra LeoneLateBack to BasicsWe Can Make It BetterLate Registration [Booklet]Curtis MayfieldJust BlazeLupe FiascoKanye WestNate ConnellyMatt GreenRichard ReitzMIKE DEANAndrew DawsonAnthony KilhofferPamela AndersonNia LongTracee Ellis RossLupe FiascoKanye WestRoc-A-Fella RecordsDef Jam RecordingsMove on UpGrowing Pains IISky HighDas Leben ist sch.Growing PainsGrowingDaSkiezThe BroadTestify (Radiohead, Kanye West)MEME MUSIC SLIDETOUCH THE SKY.mp3HOLD MY LIQUOR.mp3GrammyUp Up and AwayMaryland Ass NiggaNo MistakesSky High GraduatesTouch the SkyTouch the SkyTouch the SkyTouch The Sky (Freestyle)Touch the Sky (Live from VH1 Storytellers)Touch the Sky (Live at Abbey Road Studios)","number":"3","lyrics":"[Chorus 1: Kanye West]\nI gotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky\nGotta testify\nCome up in the spot lookin' extra fly\n'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nBack when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc\nBefore Cam got the shit to pop\nThe doors was closed\nI felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks\nNow let's go, take 'em back to the plan\nMe and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van\nAny pessimists, I ain't talk to them\nPlus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment\nLet's take 'em back to the club\nLeast about an hour I stand on line\nI just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour\nAfter I got my advance, I just wanted to shine\nJay favorite line: \"Dawg, in due time!\"\nNow he look at me, like, \"Damn, dawg!

Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional mannereveryone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".  Parents are our first acting coaches.oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-trend-is-always-late-april-18-2018-annotated"},{"title":"Two Words (Cinematic)","album":"The College Dropout: Video Anthology (2005)","artist":"View Tracklist Kanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestWe Don’t Care (Reprise)Jesus Walks (Remix)It’s Alright (Remix)The New Workout Plan (Remix)Heavy HittersNever Let Me Down (Cinematic)Kanye WestYasiin BeyTwo Words","number":"6","lyrics":"[Instrumental]\n\n[Hook: Harlem Boys Choir]\nThrow your hands up high\n'Til they reach the sky\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Hook: Harlem Boys Choir]\nThrow your hands up high\n'Til they reach the sky\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]\nRed, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)\nCalm down, move back\nMotherfuckers askin' \"who is that?\"\nYou know it's the almighty Black Jack\nMos Def, K.

It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through\nYou know, and people are human\nThey wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do\nThe other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax\nA lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in\nThe toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in\nSo, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)\nSo you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;\nYou have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job\nSo, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know\nTryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...\nThat they try to send their kids to school...\nThat they try to make a difference.\"\n\n[Answering Machine]\n\"Next message.\"","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-we-dont-care-reprise-lyrics"},{"title":"","album":"","artist":"View Tracklist Kanye WestView All Credits Kanye WestIntroGraduation DayAll Falls DownI’ll Fly AwaySpaceshipJesus WalksNever Let Me DownGet Em HighWorkout PlanThe New Workout PlanSlow JamzBreathe In Breathe OutSchool Spirit (Skit 1)School SpiritSchool Spirit (Skit 2)Lil’ Jimmy (Skit)Two WordsThrough the WireFamily BusinessLast CallHeavy HittersThe College Dropout [Booklet]Ross VannelliKanye WestManny MarroquinEugene A.

ohhh\n\n[Verse 1]\nTrying to sneak upstairs to your apartment\nAren't you a sight for red eyes?\nI just flew in and slipped in on your left side\nJust a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up\nI'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up\n\n[Hook]\nJust me and you, girl\nWooooaah ohhh\nJust me and you, girl\nWooooaah ohhh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe had problems but it's all in the past\nEverybody got problems, baby, algebra class\nRemember I used to do things that'd make you laugh\nLike orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?\nYou like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain\nOr rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain\nOr that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains\nAnd you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name\nBut, they never let us do our thing\nEverybody lying on who I bang\nWe was on fire but they blew our flame\nAin't no denying, baby, you have changed\n'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten\nYour hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping\n'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different\nFriends all diss him like, \"No he didn't?\nNo he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?\nIs that bitch still stripping?\nTrying to get a pair of Christians?\"\nI swear to God that they got you going crazy\nBut you play it off and say, \"How is work, baby?\"\nWell, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight\nBut seem to still love the man that they all hate\nBut babe, I call you back and say that you say that always\nAnd kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait\nSee, she knew about all my lies the whole time\nAnd my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign\nI would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'\nBut she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign\nNow, she back in the club in a tight dress\nWith dreams of someday wearing a white dress\nSeen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd\nTalk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag\nPlus I don't like none of her girlfriends\nQuote unquote, \"'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends\"\nOn the phone, hollin' that \"Niggas is whatever\"\nLet's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever\nNow she heading to Rome, Rome is the home\nRome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone\nI accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown\nSo I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned\nSo a nigga had to hop on a plane\nA bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain\nRented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner\nTurned the lights out and put my candle right in her\nAnd told her, \"Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress\nAt first sight I could picture you in a white dress\"\nThirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine\nJust to make up for all the years and the pain\nFamily on both sides, I'm so glad you came\nAunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame\nWedding in June, what could be better?\nLet's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever\nTake the very last car of the Eurostar\nTell the conductor, \"Just drive so far\"\nTold some of your friends and they wasn't excited\nWell, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited\nWe will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting\nTell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited\nLet's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private\nI'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh\n\n[Hook]\nJust me and you, girl\nWooooaah ohhh\nJust me and you, girl\nWooooaah ohhh","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-white-dress-lyrics"},{},{},{"title":"Who Will Survive in

untold tale of scandal\nTwo long centuries buried in the musty vault\nHosed down daily with a gagging perfume\nAmerica was a bastard\nThe illegitimate daughter of the mother country\nWhose legs were then spread around the world\nAnd a rapist known as freedom, free-doom\nDemocracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling\nIn the mother country's crotch\nWhat does Webster say about soul?\nAll I want is a good home and a wife\nAnd a children, and some food to feed them every night\nAfter all is said and done,

Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”' They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your —hey, nigga, don’t throw no shit while I’m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \"Hotline Bling.\" In my opinion — now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.Jay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain’t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I’m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second, do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second, I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!People, I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back![to DJ] Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me, I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared! I’m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision! I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready! Because the show’s over.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-radio-jay-z-and-mark-zuckerberg-annotated"},{"title":"Rich Nigga Drunk","album":"Unreleased Songs","artist":"View Tracklist TygaView All Credits Kanye WestGo2DaMoon (Original)*New Slaves (Demo)Liberated (Father Stretch My Hands Demo)Follow God (Dr. Dre Remix)Cuban LinkFall Out of Heaven (Demo)The StormTrack 6 (Demo)Black Skinhead (Demo)Rap TarantinoI Am Not HomeLovely (Ant Clemons Reference)LovelyIn Abundance (Demo)ChakrasMama’s BoyfriendFace Down (G.O.O.D.
