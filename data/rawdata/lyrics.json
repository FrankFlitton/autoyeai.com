But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber! My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know. If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come to me like, \"Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to...\" Bro, like, I love all y'all! That's why I called her! So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, \"Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next.\" And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, \"Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney.\" And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!They tell me, \"Don't compare yourself to these people,\" right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West(Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!Tonight, we're here to have fun.

I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start thisSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the moneyAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.\"So, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy ideaHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being coolI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2015-bet-honors-visionary-award-acceptance-speech-lyrics"},{},{},{"title":"30 Hours","album":"The Life of Pablo (2016)","number":"16","lyrics":"[Intro: Arthur Russell]\nBaby lion goes\nWhere the islands go\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYou say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone\nMillion dollar renovations to a happy home\nMy ex says she gave me the best years of her life\nI saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right\nI wake up, assessin' the damages\nCheckin' MediaTakeOut\nPictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch\nBut it's blurry enough to get the fake out\nI wake up, all veggies no eggs\nI hit the gym, all chest no legs\nYep, then I made myself a smoothie\nYeah, then me and wifey make a movie\nChicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nÁndale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh\nYou had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone\nYou was the best of all time at the time though\nYeah, you wasn't mine though\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nBut I still drove 30 hours\nAnd I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI remember rappin' for Jay and Cam\nYoung producer just trying to get his flows off\nI remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret\n'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off\nExpedition was Eddie Bauer edition\nI'm drivin' with no winter tires in December\nSkrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women\nThen I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl\nYou don't love me, you just pretendin'\nI need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'\nChicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nIt's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know\nGot a hotel room, three stars for you\nYou call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning\nYou realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria\nOnly thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me\nI used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'\n'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs\nBut you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time\nWell, I guess a blowjob's better than no job\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nAnd I drove back 30 hours\n\n[Bridge: Arthur Russell]\nWhere the main ties onto the sail\nBetter on sighting\nFor astern, oh\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]\n3 Stacks, can you help me out?\n30 hours\nYeah, this type of shit you just ride out to\n30 hours\n30 hours\nI just be like, it was my idea to have an open relationship\nNow a nigga mad\nNow I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill...\n30 hours\nJust to kill..\nJust to...\nJust to...\nI'm about to drive 90\n90 miles like Matt Barnes just to whoop a nigga ass\nIt was my idea and now a nigga (30 hours)\nNow a nigga mad, now a nigga, uh\nA stunna\nWhoop him after school just to show I got class\nDuh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh\nDuh-duh with you, yeah (30 hours)\nYou know what I'm sayin'?

It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, \"What's spurred that, to do it that way?\"[Kanye]I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go-- so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?[Michelle]I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say \"politics?\"[Kanye]I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?[Michelle]It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap.[Kanye]No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money.[Michelle]But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...[Kanye]No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, \"well-off\" is that, that is-- what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.[Michelle]That's fair enough, I get that.[Kanye]And then you're not well-off.[Michelle]That's-- yeah-- I'm sorry, I know it's not all about money, but I've just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and-- I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you.[Kanye]I'll-- now we are. Because of what we're doing. Because of the way we're turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But it's really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, it's hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the-- [?] who do the real work. Yeah, you get the Rihannas, the Big Seans, the Kanyes, but you need the Barry Weiss, the Steve Barlows and [?], and like these people, you know, all the people all the people who get mentioned on the Grammy speeches, and you just can't, that's-- what you're saying is like-- Okay, you're a major recording artist because you signed to a major label. Can't you just do independent clothing? The answer is, \"No.\" Now, can't you just get a clothing deal from a major label? The answer is, also, currently is, \"No.\" And that's the issue. That's the Truman Show wall. That's the glass ceilings. That's the Michael Jackson can't get his video played. Because everybody-- nobody is looking at what Obama is wearing. I'm the number one most influential person on the globe in fashion. [?] is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And that's the only way it's going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isn't where should be. Yeah I'm doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. That's the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I don't look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasn't gangsta enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting married to Kim Kardashian, and I've never played in the NBA.(Laughter)[MichelleOh my god.[Kanye]So, that's thought.[Michelle]You know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, I'm Michelle and we're live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I don't-- you definitely don't do things like everybody else. Do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, I'm not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean.[Kanye West]There's a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, there's an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that I'm saying because they'll lose their job.There is a a lack in creativity in Hollywood. There's a lack in creativity in clothing. There's a lack creativity in the education system. There's a lack in creativity on the globe period! @hen you look up and look at billboard ads, the majority of them suck. There's a lack creativity in advertising, in agencies. There's just a lack, because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for 20 years before their positioned to say the idea, and they might not have the relevancy anymore. Right now, I have the relevancy and I have the perspective and I have the voice and I'm going to scream as loud as I can. And ain't nothing gon' happen to me except success.[Michelle]You're here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that.There's so much passion because I share a lot of the same-- where the view is my passion, and I feel like people don't always get it. You know, and they're like, \"Gosh, it's kind of harsh\" with everyone. You've just got to be true to yourself. You know? I got to-- by the way, before I forget, you know with your clothing and your fashion, we were just talking about your merch line.[Kanye]Really quick, and don't forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term \"fashion,\" because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, it's been illegal to be naked. I'm helping people follow the law in style. I'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isn't about fashion. I'm creating new standards, things so you don't have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that I'm wearing. And I'll do all the hard work. I'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and-- and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. I'll do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, \"That looked crazy!\"There are certain things that are just standard. A suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket. A hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie. Jeans are jeans are jeans. And a Michael Jordan sneaker is a Michael Jordan sneaker. Now, let's take our kids to the park. It's not about fashion. It's about life, and me helping it become more awesome...(TO BE CONTINUED)","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-a-971-interview-part-2-8-28-13-annotated"},{},{},{"title":"After

talking with Jean, he was saying that it was hard for you to get into this \"fashion world\", and you were saying it was hard for Michael Jackson to put his videos on MTV. And I don't realise, how much a guy like you, that I listen to everyday, I watch everyday, and influences the use - everytime you do something, people wanna do it. So how is it possible that the big houses don't understand that?Kanye: The thought was that everything popular was very basic and not complex and the negative connotation of commercial. So soon as you're commercial, you don't have the complexity of a Bach, a Mozart, a Basquiat, and if you say out loud as a commercial person that you're in the same breath as Basquiat, then everyone looks at you like you're an egomaniac or something. But then you'll be like, wait a second, you know I was a gifted artist since age 5, and like in national competitions and went to art school. I'm actually getting an honorary doctorate on May 5th from the Art Institute of Chicago so, it was a great wall to break downBut also, what's fun about playing in the pop field versus the art field is you get a lot of exposure and the majority of the pop artists don't have the same responsibility to the sensibility so it's easy to slam dunk them. To hit that BRIT Awards performance super hard against everything else that's going on. And, but I want all the best for all of the pop stars.

It’s like the pursuit of happiness, like it’s like, you’re trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period.\n\nFuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone’s thinking. Start there... put some dope shit with it.\n\n[Applause]\n\n[Ellen DeGeneres:]\nOk, I’m with you on –\n\n[Kanye West:]\n'Ye is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay.\n\n[Ellen DeGeneres:]\nI’m with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money.\n\n[Kanye West:]\nWe’re in a renaissance period. We’re in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We’re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked.\n\nYou know, people never write, \"Kanye’s pissing everybody off.\" They try to position that through the media in some way that I’m like, \"Whatever.\" Whatever your friends might say, you know, \"I saw Kanye.\" \"How was he? Did he…?\" I care about people. I care about– my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he’s a psych major. My mom was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University. I was raised to do something, to make a difference.\n\n[Applause]\n\nTo take– you know, I didn’t take the Oscars as a joke. It was funny. You know what I’m saying, it was like the moment. All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. \"You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it, bam! Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.\"\n\nI didn’t take it as a joke. \"It ain’t no joke,\" as Rakim said. It ain’t no joke. \"I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.\" That’s what I was raised on – Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip-hop, expression. \"Hip hop started out in the park…\"\n\nEverybody’s trying to… I don’t give a fuck how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio. Are you connecting? Picasso is dead. Steve Jobs is dead. Walt Disney is dead. Name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them. Don’t tell me about being likable.\n\nWe got 100 years here. We’re one race, the human race, one civilization. We’re a blip in the existence of the universe, and we constantly try to pull each other down. Not doing things to help each other. That’s my point. It’s like I’m shaking talking about it. I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel I can make a difference while I’m here. I feel that I can make things better through my skill set. Through my skills– I’m an artist. Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago. I am an artist. I have a condition called synesthesia where I see sounds. I see them. Everything that I sonically make is a painting. I see it. I see the importance– I see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life.\n\nWhen I make clothes… It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about the environment and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, \"That’s not an important issue.\" But I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit. I called the head of Payless. I’m like, \"I want to work with you.\" I want to take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes, and I want to take away bullying.\n\n[Extended applause]\n\nYou know, I want to- Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the reason I was able to go so far in music. There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he was considered to be \"urban.\" The Michael Jackson. So I literally have to be Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone. After I’m dead. After they call me \"Wacko Kanye.\"\n\n[Audience chuckles]\n\nIsn’t that so funny? That people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most.

What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, \"no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval.\" So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin', like I've calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people could've had the proper information. And just to speak to the Dave LaChapelle, 'cause Dave LaChapelle's one of my favorite photographers, modern-day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, \"Okay well he has a god complex.\" Fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, it's because of my position, it's like I'm not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look it's my face! It's me! And sometimes it's like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit that's exciting to me. So the Rolling Stone's cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it was't speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesn't care about Black people and then people took it and said, \"Well you said, \"Bush hates Black people.\"\" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, \"Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?\" And I'm like I'm not really political dawg, I'm not getting into like you know I'm taking sides and this type of thing. He's like, \"What do you mean you're not political? You're not...\" I was like, fam! I'm emotional! I'm social! I'm like... I'm an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, I'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. I'm the glitch in the matrix, I'm like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know I'm supposed to feel like this and know I'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesn't put me... I'm never going politically incorrect or anything. I don't know about politics like that. I just know about people.

Every time I say something that’s extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet. So what are we getting all of the rest of the time?I don't care about having a legacy, I don't care about being remembered. The most important thing to me is like while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep, in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can I do, what can I do with my voice, what can we do for each other to make life easier, to make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow. You know, we were born into a broken world, we're like the cleanup crew, you knowMy mother made me believe in me. When I was growing up I wanted make video games. My mom got this Amiga computer when I was in seventh grade and it had 4,096 colors. I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes, it would stay, place another note. It would stay, place another note, and it's how I learned how to produce. In seventh grade I was just really making music to make video games. They just let me dream, they supported me, they pushed me, they didn't set me up to be inside of a box. Weston main thing that makes magic magic - the fact that no one believes it's possibleWhen I entered the fashion world and I encountered a lot of elitism and all that it just made me happy. It was something fun, we had the entire world against us. It was like absolutely no allies. Whatsoever, you know what I mean, it was like the world was against us, the pressure of that was like crazy, was like a Super Bowl. I remembered sitting there with my fashion publicist Debra and we're supposed to do the resee, these is the thing with the editors after the show so they come back to see it and see if they like the collection, and we had like two or three people that came to see it and take picture with Kanye and bla bla etc. I say \"Do we have more editors coming\", and Debra just look and says \"No, no one else is coming\", and I looked at her and said \"This is great. Remember this moment cause it won't always be like this, embrace this moment when no one came to see the collection\". I take things that people look as a negative as an inspiration to do something betterI think there are school teachers that are at the exact same mission as as me. I think there's police officers with the exact same mission as me. It's just help, it's just do everything you got, give everything you got, and, you know, our focus needs to be less about what our legacy is gonna be or how we're gonna control each other but more how can we can give to each otherKanye West on Being The Robin Hood of Fashion*Somebody please transcribe these*Kanye West on Why He's Not in a Competition With AnyoneI'm not in competition with anyone. None of us will be remembered. You know, our existence as a race, humanity in period is a blip, another second of our life in the entire scope of the universe. All these walls to keep us from loving each other as like one family, as one race, you know, racism, religion, you know, where we grew up, whatever it is, class, social network, economics, you know, all this. What makes it be so selfish, prideful, all mixes now want to help the next man, what makes us, you know, be so focus on a personal legacy as opposed to an entire legacy of a race, you know like, the dinosaurs are remembered from much more than their bones, you know. So for humanity's gone what do we give to even this little planet, you know, now wrong, and what can we do collectively, like removing the pride*Somebody please transcribe the rest*","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-interview-for-time-100-lyrics"},{},{},{},{"title":"Kanye West Talks Fashion and Surprise Concerts in Paris","album":"","number":"","lyrics":"PARIS — Fashion has a new odd couple: Bernard Arnault and Kanye WestThe luxury titan turned out Saturday night for an impromptu concert by West in the auditorium of his Fondation Louis Vuitton, the new Frank Gehry art destination that later this month will put on display Edvard Munch’s “The Scream,” Henri Matisse’s “Dance” and other modern masterpiecesWest drew a crowd packed in like sardines — the kind that hold cell phones — to hear him proclaim, “I wanna thank my original family for having me this evening, the LVMH group,” as he ripped into a version of “Runaway,” the lyrics of which include the refrain, “Let’s have a toast to the jerk-offs/That’ll never take work off.”The young crowd went wild, with Oscar-winning film director and video artist Steve McQueen twirling his scarf over his head up in the VIP box“He’s great,” Arnault said after the show, giving a thumbs-up sign and heading to West’s dressing room to offer congratulations, his classical pianist wife Hélène and four of his five children in towIt was Alexandre Arnault, 22, formerly a DJ, who pulled off the four-night attraction in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. “We organized it in two days,” he saidThe student and budding luxury executive, who already works on LVMH’s digital strategy, related that West also offered to premiere his new music video, “All Day,” directed by McQueen“You saw the film? Fantastic,” Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie NickersonMcQueen related how the project came about“Me and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, ‘I’m at Dover Street Market, where are you?’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m at Dover Street Market,’” he recalled. “I always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That’s Kanye: It’s been a wild ride.”The director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, “So Help Me God,” and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-topsIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity“As a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn’t been for my experience in Paris — learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,” said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. “It’s part of the show,” he pleadedWhile a divisive figure in fashion — many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior — West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people “that work here, the city itself, the music that’s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.”West’s ties to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009More recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included “All of the Lights” and “Ni–as in Paris.”A tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. “When I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,” West saidTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charityMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after“He fully got the color right. And it’s so perfect, I’m like, ‘Don’t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,’” she said with a smile. “I’m happy with it. It’s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, ‘Huh, what’s going on?’”Kardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration“I’ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They’ve been on my computer forever, ” she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brandLike West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a Céline style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar“My mom has the one that’s just as is. So I feel like mine’s a little special,” she said“And now it’s a really dope coat,” West concurred","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-talks-fashion-and-surprise-concerts-in-paris-lyrics"},{},{"title":"Keep My Spirit Alive","album":"DONDA: WITH CHILD","number":"","lyrics":"Lyrics from Snippet\n\n[Chorus: KayCyy & ?]\n-see (ay)\nOooh, oh ooh\nGod, I love it\nIts a little [?] pray","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-keep-my-spirit-alive-lyrics"},{"title":"Kingston, Jamaica Sunday Service Freestyle","album":"","number":"","lyrics":"For Christ I throw my hands up (hands up)All the real mean stand up (stand up)All the real mean stand upFor Christ I'm on a missionAll the real ChristiansAll the real ChristiansFor the love of love God I go hard hardFor the love of love of God I go hard hardWhen it feels so hardDon't let Satan, don't let nothing inGod I appreciate the sufferingLet me know how your Son was sovereignSo hard I need a bufferingTo take it we ain't gon' let nothing inFor Christ I go hard hardChrist Lord God GodWhen it seem too hardWhen it seem too hardI know he already won the victoryWe're writing the futureThey wrote the historyThis the truth it's no longer a mysteryWhen I see the mountains in the skiesMy daughter's eyesThats when it really gets to meThat's when it hit me hardThis could only be GodWhat's the craziest?

Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It’s beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design.First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I’m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, \"Oh, you’re not that bad after all.\" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y’all know y’all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it’s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.The, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn’t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy’s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... \"SexyBack\" album, and bro….Justin I ain’t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, \"He deserve to win Album of the Year.\"And this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I’m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!I still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!Two thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite. Y’all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don’t know what’s gonna happen tonight, I don’t know what's going to happen tomorrow bro.But all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don’t never, you know what I’m saying, I’m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We’re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we’re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.I don’t know what I’m finna lose after this. It don’t matter though, it ain’t about me, it’s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for

You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really areCuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a starYou know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with liesYou know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight.

I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking aboutHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?You see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not — [to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, [crowd chants “Kanye”] people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I’m not going to say no names or anythingBut if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?And they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”That’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we willAnd I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terroristYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do.

But this year, we gon’ piss on ‘em, on they motherfuckin’ port-a-potties.\n\nHow many of y'all don't give a fuck about what the press say? It's 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know y'all seen movies and shit. But y'all livin' a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.\n\nYou know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. I'm like, 'Little ol' me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why y'all scared of me?!' Why they so scared of me? … Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. What's the new shit out? What's the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Let's just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until I'm super old. Not until I'm super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until I'm super old. So I think it's time—hold up, f—k that toast.\n\nBut I promise y'all tonight, as I stand here, 37-years-old, this is only the beginning. This is only the beginning … Because in all honesty, I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now, this might not come off as humble, but I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. I ain't concerned about nobody that's actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but that's the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When I'm talkin' 'bout Walt Disney, when I'm talkin' 'bout Howard Hughes, when I'm talkin' 'bout Henry Ford, when I'm talkin' 'bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And I'm only 37. And right now I'm rockin' to 90,000, of y'all motherfuckers right now. So I ain't goin' at anybody on the radio. I'm goin' after Shakespeare. I'm goin' after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going after David Stern. I'm goin' after Henry Ford. I'm going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but he's my boy. Whether you believe it or not … you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe … And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe … I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times … And I know that I ain't perfect. But everything I'm not makes me everything I am.\n\nI came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin' daylight was comin' on. They said I was runnin' late. They blared my motherfuckin' tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote 'FUCK KANYE' on that shit. Y'all wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Y'all gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin' they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, I'll run that shit. This is real rock n' roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? I'm from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.\n\nSomebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was God's plan. God's plan. God's plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, it's all in God's plan. God's plan. God's plan. God's plan … So whether you believe it or not … the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me—but not in the Webster's definition of humility. It humbles me in a way that gives me strength, to know that it's in God's plan.

It's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight - an inspiration, not the lead instrument I'm the lead instrument. Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen... and Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume. But I just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left. And everything's been so homogenized. And it's all Big Business, and there's no creativity.

You’re designing again, in fashion. Tell me, what’s the difference in how you approach fashion to how you approach music? Is it similar, is it completely different?[West]: Everything in the world is exactly the same.[Meyers]: Alright, great. I don’t think we’re done but I think I’m going to sign off.[West]: Meaning like, you can do comparable people like - who would you compare Daniel Day-Lewis or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to musically, or in fashion, directing, architecturally? Who was your favorite teacher when you were growing up? It’s certain people that when - that teacher when you’re in eighth grade, that this person really cared and you knew this person cared about you as a student and gave everything they had and they were meant to do that. It’s other people that were just like getting a check or something. It’s all the same. You know, for me I give you paintings, sonic paintings. I have synesthesia; I can see sound in front of me. So, when I want to do fashion, I just want to give you sculptures. So it’s like Michelangelo; the church wanted him to paint, and he just wanted to do sculptures. So the hard – the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn’t understand, I just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures. But, due to the fact that I’m a celebrity, all these different things they’re like “no, you can’t do this, you have to do this kind of line.”So, it’s kind of the first of its kind so that’s the reason why there’s been a lot of confusion as to why I want to do it, to why is he getting so frustrated about it. It’s like: why don’t you just do music? It’s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves Béhar, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker. He can design whatever he wants and I'm like, that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative, you know, wants.And as, you know, get really successful at one thing you start to grow, and you're like - you feel like you can do more things, and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight, and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster. And people are like now in this day and age, if you don't believe it, it's like they're like \"No, Kanye, you can't run faster. This is the limit that was made. This is the walls that Michael Jackson broke down for you, and Jay Z and Russell Simmons broke down for you. This is the end of it. So I'm in the process, 2013 all of the controversy about why - I'm in the process of breaking down walls that people will understand 10 years from now - 20 years from now.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-creative-frustration-annotated"},{},{"title":"On Fern Mallis","album":"Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness","number":"","lyrics":"Since Fern Mallis, I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way. I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world. I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martin's because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design. Fame is often looked down upon in the design world so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want but we won't stop fighting. We want to innovate and we will win someday.

I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on thisI’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared.  I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared. SooooYou ain’t never seen, you ain’t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own itYou know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouthYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we hadAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. StarBut what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long timeAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you canSo I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a foolMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?I’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like thatSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalizedSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit upBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”And right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?And what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s showBut he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?But I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Mark's, and we gon’ take ’em from the streetAnd I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…Hold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now!

Politics","album":"Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness","number":"","lyrics":"[On tour merchandise featuring the Confederate flag imagery]\n\nReact how you want. Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That’s my abstract take on what I know about it.\n\nSo I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It’s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?\n\n[...]\n\nIt looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.\n\nIt’s colorless also. It’s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that’s really what my style’s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.\n\nMy dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he’d get around Black people and they’d kinda discriminate against him because they’d say he acted ‘white’ or talked ‘white.’ So there are times when I’ll talk and you’ll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white’--the suburb voice come through and it’s times you’ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I’m influenced by all those things.\n\nI lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she’s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn’t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.\n\n[...]\n\nThere will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It’s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it’s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I’m the only 36 year old me! I’m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don’t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.\n\n[Do you talk to corporations like that? They don’t like being uncomfortable.]\n\nWe are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we’re being a gated community doesn’t mean that things are comfortable.\n\nThe thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we’re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There’s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.\n\nLike, politics is dead. It’s over with.

Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?\n\n[crowd shouts “Kanye” and other names]\n\nNope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.\n\nRadio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’ma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Aye, is it, “'Radio, fuck you?' That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.\n\nNot fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It’s life.\n\nWe’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free?” Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro!\n\nAnd let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I’m on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!\n\nKhaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro!\n\nSo, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”' They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your —hey, nigga, don’t throw no shit while I’m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.\n\nBeyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \"Hotline Bling.\" In my opinion — now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!\n\nBut sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.\n\nJay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain’t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I’m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.\n\nIt’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second, do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second, I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!\n\nPeople, I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!\n\nMark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!\n\n[to DJ] Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.\n\nShia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.\n\nQ-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me, I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared! I’m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision! I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready!

You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference\n\nI just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice\n\nWhat is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom\n\nRespect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids\n\nThat is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much\n\nAnd yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes\n\nI'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now\n\nNew album coming this summer\n\nI love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up\n\nThe world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth\n\nYou won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me.

We ain't finna play with them no more. \"***Flawless\", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé. And at this point, we're tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration. We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity. That's the reason why I didn’t say anything tonight. But y'all know what it meant when 'Ye walks on the stage","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-grammys-2-lyrics"},{"title":"On Truthfulness","album":"Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness","number":"On Truthfulness","lyrics":"I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night.

But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump. [audience boos]\n\nNow, there’s people that I love that did vote that voted for Hillary and I don’t love them no less because they had their opinion. I love friends that I have that voted on Hillary. My manager, Scooter Braun, voted on Hillary. One of my management team. My other manager, Izzy, I’m gonna assume voted on Hillary. Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y’all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter. That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage. That don’t mean that I don’t believe in these things because that was the guy I would have voted for.\n\nRun the next song.\n\nBelieve that there are people here enjoying, or before I start talking at least, enjoying a Kanye West show. By a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a Kanye West show who voted for Trump? [audience screams] Oh, it sound differently from before, huh? It sounds different. Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn’t, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn’t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.\n\nHow that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I’m not setting y’all up, I’m not setting y’all up I’ve got no time for bullshit–what I’m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I’m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?\n\nI haven’t talked about anybody’s stances on anything. I haven’t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That’s not what I’m talking ’bout. That’s not what I’m asking you. What I’m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don’t know they might think I’m like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y’all should go ahead and….” It’s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That’s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don’t say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That’s the reality.\n\nWell, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain’t even vote? I’m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I’m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. “Aw you ain’t gonna get it now because of what you just said.” It was proof that it didn’t matter what nobody just said! It doesn’t matter!\n\nIt might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, “Oh, this rapper” because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I’m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn’t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don’t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There’s possibilities inside of books. There’s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?\n\nDon’t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president’s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don’t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.\n\nOh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That’s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That’s a woman right there saying, “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump’s campaign. That’s not supposed to happen, right? No! That’s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we’re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There’s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.\n\nI don’t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I’m not saying that, “Aw man, that just mean that anybody can win.” That’s not what I’m saying when I say 2020. I’ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It’s that, “Oh, I don’t fuck with your principles so now I’m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.” Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.\n\nMan, and you know what also? I’m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that’s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I’m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It’d be like white people that’s racist running around saying “niggas” now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I’m saying. It’s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen. Sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-voting-for-trump-annotated"},{"title":"Oof","album":"","number":"","lyrics":"Oof","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-oof-lyrics"},{},{},{},{"title":"Overreact","album":"Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 2 (2006)","number":"9","lyrics":"Ayo\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nThe G500s with the auto-roll wheels\nPinot Grigio, got 'em on chill\nSee now, see me ho?

[inaudible]. I want you to explain what the problem with education is.\n\n[Summer]\nThe problem with education is they don’t stick up for minorities or people who aren’t in [inaudible]…\n\n[Kanye]\nHold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.\n\n[Audience]\nYes sir.\n\n[Kanye]\n[inaudible] then explain the issue.\n\n[Summer]\nMy name is Summer [?]. I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…\n\n[Kanye]\nI know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say Mm-hmm I feel that\" or \"Mm-hmm, I feel that\". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, \"I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves\" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the [inaudible].\n\nWhen she says, We have completely expressed our point…[interrupted] who is that?\n\n([We can’t hear you in the back])\n\nYou can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?\n\nYou see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.\n\n[Kanye]\nSummer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go.\n\n[Summer]\nOkay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.\n\nThere’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…\n\n[Kanye]\n[inaudible], history.\n\nSummer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.\n\n[Summer]\nIs that okay with you guys?\n\n[Audience]\nYes!\n\n[Kanye]\nWait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…\n\nQuiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.\n\n[Audience]\nYes!\n\n[Kanye West]\nSo, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round.\n\n[Audience]\nYes!\n\n[Kanye]\nInside of the very first rally. [crosstalk] I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.\n\n[Summer]\nOkay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.\n\n[inaudible] social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.\n\n[Kanye]\nPause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.\n\nNow Summer, go ahead.\n\n[Summer]\nSo on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.\n\nSummer: (06:04)\nThere’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.\n\nKanye West: (06:04)\nRaise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.\n\nLauren: (06:04)\nMy name is Lauren McLeod.\n\nKanye West: (06:04)\nThis is Lauren McLeod.\n\nKanye West: (08:43)\nI understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? [inaudible 00:08:49]. Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.\n\nKanye West: (09:32)\nAnd that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.\n\nKanye West: (09:33)\nWait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?\n\nAudience: (09:33)\nNo.\n\nKanye West: (09:33)\nDid you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.\n\nAudience: (09:33)\nOh.\n\nKanye West: (09:33)\nWe’re ready.\n\nLauren: (10:07)\nEducation is an important topic. Education…[inaudible 00:10:07]\n\nKanye West: (10:09)\nWe have no microphone.[inaudible 00:10:09]. You got it.\n\nLauren: (10:09)\nEducation starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.\n\nLauren: (10:42)\n[inaudible 00:10:42], with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?\n\nKanye West: (11:09)\nOkay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to [inaudible 00:11:09], I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.\n\nKanye West: (11:26)\nIn Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.\n\nKanye West: (11:34)\nPercocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this [inaudible 00:11:34] mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.\n\nKanye West: (12:34)\nIt said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.\n\nKanye West: (12:55)\nUno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”\n\nLauren: (12:55)\nOkay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…\n\nKanye West: (12:55)\nAbout pride.\n\nLauren: (13:41)\nYeah, different places in the United States are trying to [inaudible 00:13:41]. I grew up in [inaudible 00:13:41]. I repeat [inaudible 00:13:48]. [inaudible 00:13:47], they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. [inaudible 00:13:55], dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair [inaudible 00:14:03]. If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person [inaudible 00:14:09], truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.\n\nLauren: (13:41)\nAnd I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.\n\nKanye West: (14:51)\nI understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.\n\nKanye West: (14:55)\nThis reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? [crosstalk 00:14:59].\n\nKanye West: (14:58)\nStephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.\n\nKanye West: (15:38)\nThe National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.\n\nKanye West: (16:03)\nTalking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.\n\nKanye West: (16:41)\nIn risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.\n\nKanye West: (17:59)\nWe pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.\n\nKanye West: (19:15)\nWait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pause\n\nKanye West: (20:24)\nHe set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.\n\nKanye West: (20:47)\nI see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.\n\nKanye West: (21:05)\nNow let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.\n\nKanye West: (21:09)\nSo…[inaudible 00:21:10] [inaudible 00:21:10] most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be [inaudible 00:21:26] most original languages and we, all these people,[inaudible 00:21:26]. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.\n\nKanye West: (21:47)\nThe statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like [inaudible 00:22:16].\n\nKanye West: (22:19)\nSo my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it [inaudible 00:22:23] that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.\n\nKanye West: (22:22)\nSo, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God [inaudible 00:22:52]. Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.\n\nKanye West: (23:19)\nYou already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.\n\nKanye West: (24:03)\nI know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.\n\nKanye West: (24:30)\nYou know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.\n\nKanye West: (24:58)\n[inaudible 00:24:58].\n\nAudience: (24:58)\nWe love you Kanye.\n\nKanye West: (24:58)\nI almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.\n\nKanye West: (28:50)\nAnd then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a [inaudible 00:28:50] deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.\n\nKanye West: (28:50)\nMy idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?\n\nAudience: (28:50)\nNo.\n\nKanye West: (28:50)\nCalm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.\n\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nWhat about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? [inaudible 00:28:51] What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?\n\nKanye West: (28:51)\nNow everyone be quiet so you can hear us. [inaudible 00:27:18]. Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.\n\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nSingle moms with no family. Single moms…\n\nKanye West: (28:51)\nExactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. [inaudible 00:27:47]. How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.\n\nAudience: (28:51)\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nKanye, I love you. [inaudible 00:28:18]. You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.\n\nKanye West: (28:51)\nLet me tell you. The Bible says…\n\nSpeaker 1: (28:56)\nThe Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.[inaudible 00:28:56].\n\nKanye West: (29:10)\nWhen I said I had…[inaudible 00:29:10].[inaudible 00:29:21]. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.\n\nKanye West: (30:06)\nAmber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce [inaudible 00:30:35], I mean of getting an abortion.\n\nKanye West: (30:39)\nI understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.\n\nKanye West: (31:16)\nPeople always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.\n\nKanye West: (32:03)\nBreak every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”\n\nKanye West: (32:24)\nWhen a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that. [crosstalk 00:32:39] So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.\n\nGeorgia: (33:00)\nWhat are you? Nothing? [crosstalk 00:33:00]\n\nKanye West: (33:07)\nI am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.\n\nSpeaker 2: (33:18)\nWhy’d you delete it?\n\nKanye West: (33:24)\nBecause I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in [inaudible 00:33:43] looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.\n\nKanye West: (34:00)\nWhat I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. [crosstalk 00:34:23] Does anyone know [crosstalk 00:34:23] TMZ.\n\nSpeaker 2: (34:23)\nF*** TMZ!\n\nKanye West: (34:23)\n[crosstalk 00:34:23] quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?\n\nAudience: (34:35)\nYeah.\n\nKanye West: (34:37)\nOkay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to [crosstalk 00:35:22].\n\nKanye West: (35:23)\nI care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much [inaudible 00:35:31] because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee [crosstalk 00:35:39] this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. [crosstalk 00:35:50]\n\nKanye West: (35:34)\nHow do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?\n\nSpeaker 2: (35:34)\nWhen we steal.\n\nGeorgia: (35:34)\nWhen we lie.\n\nKanye West: (35:34)\nWhen we steal. How else?\n\nGeorgia: (35:34)\nWhen we lie.\n\nKanye West: (35:34)\nLie.\n\nAudience: (35:34)\nCheat.\n\nKanye West: (36:06)\nWhen we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. [crosstalk 00:36:25] I don’t think the last… [inaudible 00:36:29] a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.\n\nAudience: (36:53)\n[inaudible 00:36:53] Talk up! [inaudible 00:37:02] [crosstalk 00:37:12]\n\nKanye West: (37:19)\nWait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.\n\nGeorgia: (38:04)\nI just think my [inaudible 00:38:04]. I don’t think we should say [crosstalk 00:38:15].\n\nKanye West: (38:20)\nLet me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for [crosstalk 00:38:31]. Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. [crosstalk 00:39:11]\n\nKanye West: (39:14)\nMaximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. [crosstalk 00:39:20] Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five [crosstalk 00:39:29]. We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. [crosstalk 00:39:57]\n\nKanye West: (39:57)\nWhen you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the [crosstalk 00:40:21], bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?\n\nAudience: (40:29)\nYep. Yeah.\n\nKanye West: (40:31)\nOkay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? [crosstalk 00:41:02] But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. [crosstalk 00:41:12]\n\nKanye West: (41:12)\nLet me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a [crosstalk 00:41:13] thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is [crosstalk 00:41:41].” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do. [crosstalk 00:42:28]\n\nKanye West: (42:27)\nOne second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. [crosstalk 00:42:40] wait a second. You need to hear this. [crosstalk 00:42:54] this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?\n\nKanye West: (43:19)\nWe got, we’re going to have to, you’re very [crosstalk 00:43:20]. Come up here, you’re third. [crosstalk 00:43:20] I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Wait a second. I must [crosstalk 00:43:20] that I did smoke a little bit last night. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. [crosstalk 00:44:26] Light up right now. [crosstalk 00:44:40] Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that [crosstalk 00:44:55] Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. [crosstalk 00:45:00]\n\nAudience: (43:19)\nI love Michael!\n\nKanye West: (43:19)\nOh, do we still love Michael?\n\nAudience: (45:11)\nYeah! [crosstalk 00:45:11]\n\nKanye West: (45:11)\nDo y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?\n\nAudience: (45:17)\nYeah! [crosstalk 00:45:17]\n\nKanye West: (45:17)\nBe quiet. He’s talking about opioids.\n\nGary: (45:17)\nI want to talk about opioids and [inaudible 00:45:39].\n\nAudience: (45:17)\nSpeak up!\n\nGary: (45:17)\nIt’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.\n\nKanye West: (45:55)\nAnd by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.\n\nAudience: (46:13)\nNobody!\n\nKanye West: (46:14)\nThat’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to [crosstalk 00:46:14]\n\nGary: (46:14)\nI’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to [crosstalk 00:46:14].\n\nKanye West: (46:14)\nWhat I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have [crosstalk 00:46:40] more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. [crosstalk 00:47:00] Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.\n\nKanye West: (48:00)\nBecause I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?\n\nKanye West: (48:07)\nNo that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. [inaudible 00:48:07].\n\nKanye West: (48:07)\nHey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.\n\nKanye West: (48:07)\nReal talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. [inaudible 00:49:18].People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.\n\nKanye West: (49:50)\nWhen I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and [inaudible 00:50:54] through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?\n\nKanye West: (51:14)\nBecause ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to [inaudible 00:52:24] people. And every time that you make a comment [inaudible 00:52:32].\n\nKanye West: (52:53)\nAnd you are adding to the attention of them not understanding [inaudible 00:52:53]. That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?\n\nShiloh: (53:36)\nI have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the [inaudible 00:53:36] free of slaves and how [inaudible 00:53:39]. Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about [inaudible 00:53:45].\n\nKanye West: (54:36)\nI will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? [inaudible 00:55:17]. No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\nI appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting [inaudible 00:56:05].\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\nYou know what…you know what’s so funny? [inaudible 00:56:33]. We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\nNow, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\nI’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\n400 years is related to the bible. [inaudible 00:58:19] African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.\n\nKanye West: (59:38)\nYou probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.\n\nKanye West: (59:39)\nGive me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be [inaudible 00:59:58] black church. That’s some true sh**.\n\nKanye West: (01:00:19)\nEverybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. [inaudible 01:00:19]. Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings [inaudible 01:00:36]. Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.\n\nKanye West: (01:01:12)\nThat was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020.

What would be a word that's the opposite of separation?\n\"Joining communication\"?\n\"Joining communication\"\n\"Our daughter arrived home\"\nInstead of saying \"My kid came home from school\"\nYou can't say \"Kid, came, that, got\"\nYou see, um, grandmothers tell you \"Don't say got\"\nYou know what I'm sayin'?

2: Kanye West]\nOh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental\nYou know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental\nEvery time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental\nWe had an incident, but I cover incidentals\nYou want me workin' on my messagin'\nWhen I'm thinkin' like George Jetson\nBut soundin' like George Jefferson\nThen they questionin' my methods then\nIf you tweakin' out on my texts again\nThen I don't get reception here\nI got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere\nI use the same attitude that done got us here\nI live for now, I don't know what happen after here\nI live for now, I don't know what happen after here\nPlus, what was meant to be was meant to be\nEven if, publicly, I lack the empathy\nI ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries\nOne

We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight.  Please welcome Kanye West![Kanye enters]JK:  How are you?Kanye West:  I'm okay.JK:  I'm very happy that you came.  I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up.  I really felt bad about all this stuff.  I did.KW:  Mm-hmm. [Laughter]JK:  I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?KW: It's Ralph.JK: Kramden? Lauren?JK: Is that a new grill you have there?KW: Nah they've been in my mouth for three years.JK: That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you.KW: Good seeing you too.JK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you’re coming from is that true?KW: Yeah, correct.JK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview  with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I’ll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the [Zane Lowe] interview when we did this sketch.KW: Yeah, that’s what I thought.JK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn’t think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?Little Kanye: I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?!JK: I'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse. I think it’s funny. (*Kanye laughs*) And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that’s not true. In fact, we’ve done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them. Of course this is not something you knew. And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. And you called me. A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up. But this isn't, right?KW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don’t do publicity stunts, period. So don’t ever think that.JK: Me neither guys. (Laughter) So we talked on the phone, and I didn’t really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?KW: Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way through because I didn't want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men… that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute.JK: And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didn't wanna go back to high school.JK: And this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about. This zoo animal, it's a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and I think people look at you and they go, \"this is a guy who’s got millions of dollars, he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can’t possibly hurt this guy.\" And to be honest, even though I’m in that same position too - I don't have a baby - it’s not something that comes to my mind when I’m cooking up a comedy sketch. And some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. And it's... but on the other hand, I will say a lot of times you I think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you.I personally found it odd to be in the position that I was in because I often… I don’t know if you know this, a lot of people think you’re a jerk. And I often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, I know this guy, he is not a jerk. In fact I think we have a picture which I happened to see on my Dad's iPad at the wedding and it's you and my Dad [*shows a photo of Kanye with Kimmel's dad] - who you may have though was Wolf Blitzer in fairness - but I mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a Southwest Airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. Everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know I have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior. But what I observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and I’ve always said that to people about you. And I think that's important for... I know part of you doesn’t care, I see you onstage saying, \"I don’t want to hold your baby, I’ll drop your baby on it’s head…\" you know I don’t believe any of that stuff when you say it.KW: I’m not running for office, I’m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that [Zane Lowe] interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of “just a celebrity.” Because you know for me, I’m a creative genius and there’s no other way to word it. I know you’re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples’ lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that’s what I was talking about on the Zane interview.So when I come on here, I can laugh and I can joke, and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it’s bigger than who I am and my presence, living. It’s about when I was on Earth what did I do to help? And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this box. But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. Once you learn how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors. I have an art background even before I was a musician. People told me I couldn’t rap. People had all this advice for me about how I shouldn't try to rap. And I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I said. Whereas if you look at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. Because most people just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras. Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. And ya know that's the reason why I went so crazy.JK: I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you’re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they’re geniuses, and nobody says it because it’s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say \"I am a genius\"…KW: I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.JK: That's true, it’s false humility.KW: Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here’s your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. But it's like that's not what we're doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame,  because they said something like they’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star. It's like people are so so dated and not modern. There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth. It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed. So you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.[Applause]JK: Alright, Kanye West is here, more with Kanye when we come back.Announcer: The best tweets of Kanye West.Josh Groban: Can we please toast to the motherfuckin' douchebags tonight?

It was a five, I’d give it. So I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob?\n\n[Kanye]\nIt’s the first thing that came to my mind.\n\n[Kimmel]\nWhere were you when you were writing those tweets.

As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life. You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say anything anymore. But just to completely wild out…\n\nThe only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth.\n\n[Kimmel]\nIt was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight.\n\n[Kanye]\nI just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I do everything I can to break media.\n\n[Kimmel]\nFrom my standpoint, sometimes I’ll think of things and maybe it’s two o’clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, “Don’t tweet that. Do not tweet that.” Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don’t care.\n\n[Kanye]\nYou shoulda saw the second set of tweets…\n\n[Kimmel]\nSave them for next time.\n\nI do just want to say congratulations on your new baby.

I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there’s some tiny little leather jogging pants\n\n[Kanye]\nFashion isn’t always practical. It’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag. It’s more about, you know, pussy. It’s more about, like, club. It’s more about style and stuff.\n\nI remember me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision. We sat as interns at Fendi like six years ago. We had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the reason I brought that up in the Zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. It became  a phenomenon over the past three years. And it was to say, you know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these  big brands your ideas and everything.” And it would just be like, what I was trying to express in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could put the proper production around them. So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together. But if I go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?” But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like really genius.” You need that production.\n\nBut currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. And that’s what I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the boat.\n\n[Kimmel]\nWhat about a Steve Harvey collection?\n\n[Kanye]\nYeah, no. There’s no Steve Harvey collection. No extra buttons on jackets or anything like that.\n\nBut for Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson had to fight to get his videos on MTV because he was considered to be “urban.” This is Michael Jackson.\n\n[Kimmel]\nThat’s true. He was considered a Black artist and was not right for MTV at that time.\n\n[Kanye]\nYeah, a black artist. So, for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names. Like stuff you can’t even say on TV. And I still can’t break that wall down. At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who’s known more for clothes than me? To not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, Leanne [?].  These are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. Zara, out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone. And everyone just sort of looks at you  like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet. And you’re just like, “How can you get a shot?” And then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.\n\nI mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels  I wanted to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. He just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.  So if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I talked about.\n\nPaula Deen, she was old-school with it. They’re like, “We don’t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen. We’re classist now.” So this classism is what they do to try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality show. You’re not up here with us. You know, we’re old money, we--\n\n[Kimmel]\nIt’s snobbery--\n\n[Kanye]\nIt’s snobbery. And I’m not into all that snobbery. Because, you know what? We have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. All we want is a real shot.  Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. No, I understand about quality. I understand about fabrics. I spent ten thousand hours at this. I’ve dedicated my life to this. And a lot of people say, “OK, you have to do music.” I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened? What if people told me I couldn’t perform. I’m only 36 years old; I have other goals and other things.  And I’m gonna use my platform,  every platform, to stand up and say, “I want to make something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.” That was the point of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. [Turns to Kimmel]\n\nAnd the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m the one creative, and this is the reason why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s moments when I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing. Come and kill me. Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to bully me, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.” No matter how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself! Stop seeing what you can do! Stop affirming what you’re gonna do and then completing that in real life.” That’s the improper way to do it. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people  with low self-esteem. With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules.\n\nIt’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. The time you spend with your family, that’s the only luxury. So this concept of “luxury” is improper to me. You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.” I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. This is what I’m here to do, so  when I compare myself to Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, David Stern, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Jesus of whatever it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes. These are people I look up to. This is the type of impact I want to make on the earth.” If I can make this type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a shot.” If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid. This kid, his parents were educators. He wants to educate. He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”\n\nExactly what I did in music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply to education. This is what my company Donda is about. I could rap all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain. I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it to the point to make “Jesus Walks.” And now, even as a celebrity,  I’ve reached a ceiling. And the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. We bring something of joy to the world. When people hear my music they have a good time. And I should be respected as such when I walk down the street. Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. Don’t try to antagonize me. Cause, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo. Never think that I’m not from Chicago for one second. And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly.\n\nAnd people say, “Well, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, but let’s have respect for each other. You do help me get money, paparazzi,  you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people.\n\n[Kimmel]\nBut when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there’s no human decency there.\n\n[Kanye]\nIt’s a lack of decency.\n\n[Kimmel]\nKanye West, everybody.","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-jimmy-kimmel-interview-part-2-annotated"},{"title":"Ambitious*","album":"Unreleased Songs","number":"","lyrics":"Lyrics from Snippet\n\n[Verse]\nWon't until it take me\nThe devil weak, the devil weak\nDevil thought I [?]\nBought her a ceiling\nI've been back from addiction\nI done beat they prediction...","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ambitious-lyrics"},{"title":"All Day (2 Chainz Version)","album":"Unreleased Songs","number":"All Day (2 Chainz Version)","lyrics":"[Intro: Kanye West & (Theophilus London)]All day, nigga(Dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy)[Chorus: Kanye West]All day, niggaHow long you niggas ball?

HovitoThe game gettin' foul so here's a free throwI was always on the other side of the peepholeThen I dropped \"Jesus Walks\" now I'm on the steepleAnd we know, \"New Jack City\"—got to keep my brotherBut to be number one I'ma beat my brotherOn that \"Diamonds\" remix I swore I spazzedThen my big brother came through and kicked my assSibling rivalry, only I could seeIt was the pride in me that was drivin' meAt the Grammys I said, \"I inspired me\"But my big brother who I always tried to beWhen I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-rollCause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-goI guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunkAnd my shit was more like a finger rollBut I had them singles thoughAnd them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all knowI told Jay I did a song with ColdplayNext thing I know he got a song with ColdplayBack in my mind I'm like, \"Damn, no way\"Translate, español: \"No way, José\"Then I went and told Jay BrownShoulda known that was gonna come back aroundShoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you firstBut I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse[Bridge]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherSo here's a few words from ya kid brotherIf you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'emPeople never get the flowers while they can still smell 'emA idol in my eyes, god of the gameHeart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chainNever be the same, never be anotherNumber one, Young Hov, also my big brother[Hook]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friendNo I.D.,

West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: \"Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\" The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black communityWest performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches.

He has six life sentences and they have him next to the unibomber doing 23 and 1 … Really the reason why they imprisoned [Larry Hoover] is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice but he could wrap people around, so there’s theories that there's infinite amounts of universe, and there's alternate universe, so it's very important for me to get Hoover out because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago and it's not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer, and having a monolithic voice that's forced to be a specific party.“You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat they say – you know first of all, it’s a limit to amount of jobs, so the fathers lose the job and they say, ‘We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.' And then we got rid of the mental health institutes in the 80s and the 90s and the prison rates just shot up. And now you have Chiraq, what people call Chiraq, which actually, our murder rate is going down by 20 per cent every year. I just talked to the superintendent, met with Michael Sacks, that’s Ron's right hand man. So, I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends, but this hat, it gives me power in a way.“You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And also I’m married now into a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on, it's beautiful though. But there's times where, you know, it's something about, I love Hillary, I love everyone, right, but the campaign “I'm With Her” just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made us Superman, that's my favorite superhero, and you made a Superman cape for me.“Also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys. Non-political, no bullshit [looks at media members] – put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay – and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. When I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now, we have $38 billion market cap. It's called “The Yeezy Effect.” And went and I said, “You have to bring manufacturing on-shore. Not even on-shore, into the core. It's not about the borders. The core of Adidas, and Chicago, is the core of middle America, and we have to make middle America strong.“So, I had the balls, because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal, than to have no fathers in Chicago, with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, not rehabilitation, because they didn't have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone who taught us, they didn't teach us. Then any specific deal, anything, that we bring jobs into America. And that we provide a transition with mental health and the AmeriCan education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he's worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWorks has beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation.“There's a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things, that puts us back into that trap door that's called the 13th Amendment. I did say, “abolish,” with the hat on, because why would you keep something around that's a trap door. If you building a floor, the constitution is the base of our industry, of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Uni-bomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship. The four gentleman that wrote the 13th Amendment, and I think the way the universe works is perfect, we don't have 13 floors, do we? You know, the four gentleman that wrote the 13th amendment didn't look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans, to read. So, that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you'd get locked up! And turned into a slave. Again, so what I think is, we don't need sentences, we need pardons. We need to talk to people.“I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain, it's equal on three parts. I'm gonna go ahead, drop some bombs for you. 98 percentile IQ test, I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting eight numbers backwards, so I'm gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent, Tesla, Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10-20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name. So, all this power that I've got, and I'm taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn't be able to remember his name, from a misdiagnosis. What we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That's one thing, I've never stepped into a situation where I didn't make people more money. So, we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories, we can bring, not only Adidas on shore, we could bring Foxconn and set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota [corrected by Trump that it's Wisconsin].“Yeah, Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs, people making 53,000 a year. And one of the things we gotta set is, Ford to have the highest designs. The dopest cars. The most amazing. I don't really say, “dope,” I don't say negative words and try to flip ‘em. We just say positive, lovely, divine, universal words. So, the flyest, freshest, most amazing car. And what we start with, is – I brought a GIF with me right here. [Scrolls through iPhone to show Trump.] This right here is the iPlane 1. It's a hydrogen powered airplane, and this is what our president should be flying in. We're gonna have Apple, an American company, work on this plane.“What I need Saturday Night Live to improve on, or what I need the liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good [pointing to Trump], we don't look good. This is our President. He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be empowered. We have to bring jobs into America, because our best export is entertainment and ideas. But when we make everything in China and not America, then we're cheating on our country, and we're putting people in positions to have to do illegal things to end up in the cheapest factory every, the prison system.”","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-monologue-at-the-white-house-annotated"},{"title":"Last Call","album":"The College Dropout","number":"21","lyrics":"[Produced by Evidence & Kanye West][Intro: JAY-Z]Aight, let's run it, let's run itYo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremostFor making me do this shit.

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forthJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' withSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youSo won't you raise your glass won't youAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"No ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"[Saxophone Solo]I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back thenI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"[JAY-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]And I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]Dame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wowI got 11 plaques on my walls right nowYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do.

If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonightTonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect. [???] A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the mostYou know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, trueCause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. [?] I find [?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!I ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm rememberingCause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreamingI feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool.

Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that’s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. [?]. “You’re my M.A.S. and I’m your Nicholas.” And her brother’s a doctor. And somehow in her family she’s looked at like she didn’t do as much  in her life ‘cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit togetherAnd I honest.. I’mma jump to a point just so I don’t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I’m a Christian, I’m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we’re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we’re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they’re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, “oh, you’re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.” No knock to lawyers, but you know what I’m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” Nah, I’m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, “you think you not part of fashion because you don’t datatata.” Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let’s make the conversation, you know, let’s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl’s’ or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currencyWhen we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew ‘cause he’s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say “wow,” you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that’s word fashion insiders, but everyone’s a fashion insider, you know. It’s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it’s, the point I wanna make before I bring ‘em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design ‘cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, “Kanye you can’t get in this show ‘cause you’re a celebrity” or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley’s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I’m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I’mma say what the fuck he should’ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don’t even know if I made one fucking good pointBut what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn’t figure out where my office was. We didn’t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We’d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn’t about me being a celebrity ‘cause it could’ve been like, “what do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..” All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I’m closing now. I don’t move, I don’t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don’t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I’m so happy that Jeremy is here ‘cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I’m not gonna say shit else. So all I’mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-dailys-fashion-los-angeles-awards-speech-lyrics"},{"title":"The Best IS","album":"The Graduate (Extra Credit)","number":"29","lyrics":"Lyrics for this song have yet to be released.

It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through\nYou know, and people are human\nThey wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do\nThe other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax\nA lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in\nThe toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in\nSo, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)\nSo you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;\nYou have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job\nSo, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know\nTryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...\nThat they try to send their kids to school...\nThat they try to make a difference.\"\n\n[Answering Machine]\n\"Next message.\"","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-we-dont-care-reprise-lyrics"},{"title":"We Got Love","album":"Yandhi","number":"We Got Love","lyrics":"[Chorus: The Younghearts]We got love, love, loveYou better believe it[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]I got house and a carriage, yeahI got Black love and marriage, yeahThey gon' say you can’t have it, butI'm like, \"Don't kill the messenger\"We gon’ break the stigma upHuxtables turned to ObamasIt ain't about where you been, where you fromWhat you gotIt's all about loveSelf-love is the best loveWhen you gon' take that wristband off?That pity party been overDon't need make-up to dress you upI gave birth on the bathroom floorJust me, Iman, and headphone cordsDon't let this life defeat youI hope this message reach you[Refrain: Teyana Taylor]Throw your hands upPlay catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart isThrow your hands upPlay catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI’m just chillin’ with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh![Chorus: The Younghearts & Teyana Taylor]We got love, love, loveYou better believe it (Say, love, love)We got love, love, loveYou better believe it (Say, love, love)[Verse 2: Kanye West]I live in abundance, love is the new moneyI'm mentally wealthy, spiritually consciousI’m fresh out of Onyx, I'm ballin', I'm ballin’I play with the hunnids, love is the new moneyThat's my frequency, stock up, burn the sageClear the room, heal the hate, love is the new wave[Refrain: Kanye West]Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart isPlay catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is (Ahh!)[Chorus: The Younghearts & Teyana Taylor]We got love, love, loveYou better believe it (Say, love, love)We got love, love, loveYou better believe it (Say, love, love)[Refrain: Teyana Taylor]Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new moneyI'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!(Throw your hands up, throw your hands up)[Outro: Lauryn Hill]Above all you keep your clarityYou keep your focusYou keep your sense of loveAnd you keep your sense of purposeThose are, they're integralYou know, they're keyHappinessYou know, um a lot of people define success differentlyYou know for meYou can have everythingYou could have all the money in the worldBut if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you knowIf you can't be a person of integrity while having all these thingsWhat does it matter?What does it mean?The value is internalYour value is internal","url":"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-we-got-love-lyrics"},{"title":"We Major","album":"Late Registration","number":"14","lyrics":"[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell][Chorus: Really Doe]You motherfuckers better do your job and roll upAnd watch how we roll up, andI can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nutsI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuckI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuckBut really what's amazing is how I keep blazingTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's endPuff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotationHpnotiq for Henny?

you I'm goin' back to school\nI appreciate what you allowed for me\nI just want you to be proud of me\n(Hey Mama)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine\nThis little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine\nI'm finna take y'all back to them better times\nI'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind\nI was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi\nLate December, harsh winter gave me a cold\nYou fixed me up something that was good for my soul\nFamous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?\nYou work late nights just to keep on the lights\nMommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike\nAnd you would give anything in this world\nMichael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl\nAnd you never put no man over me\nAnd I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?\nSeven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes\n'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry\nAs we knelt on the kitchen floor\nI said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more\nAnd when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more\nAnd I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford\nSee you're unbreakable, unmistakable\nHighly capable, lady that's makin' loot\nA livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do\nSend us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hey Mama)\nI wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you\nLet me tell you what I'm about to do\n(Hey Mama)\nI know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school\nI appreciate what you allowed for me\nI just want you to be proud of me\n(Hey Mama)\n\n[Verse 2]\nForrest Gump mama said, \"Life is like a box of chocolates\"\nMy mama told me go to school, get your doctorate\nSomethin to fall back on, you could profit with\nBut still supported me when I did the opposite\nNow I feel like it's things I gotta get\nThings I gotta do, just to prove to you\nYou was getting through, can the choir, please\nGive me a verse of \"You Are So Beautiful To Me\"\nCan't you see, you're like a book of poetry\nMaya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy\nCome on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet\nNow when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hey Mama)\nI wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you\nLet me tell you what I'm about to do\n(Hey Mama)\nI know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school\nI appreciate what you allowed for me\nI just want you to be proud of me\n(Hey Mama)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI guess it also depends though if my ends low\nSecond, they get up you gon get that Benzo\nTint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)\nTell your job you gotta fake em out\nSince you brought me in this world, let me take you out\nTo a restaurant, upper echelon\nI'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want\nJust tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?\nTell me the perfect color so I make it just right\nIt don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday\nFor me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you\nLet me tell you what I'm about to do\n(Hey Mama)\nYou know I love you so\nI never let you go\nWrote this song just so you know\nNo matter where you go our love is true\nMama mama mama mama
